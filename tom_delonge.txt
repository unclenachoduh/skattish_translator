You are better than me,girls,money,and everything I try to compete with you,
but you beat me at everything i do
I see in you the things that I would like to be
But im different from you,

So you will have to be like me!

I cannot be bought my personality is what I choose
I was brought up without a silver cup I wont
covet the things owned by you

For all the world material things are now more and more
jealousy for you and me
I won't covet the things owned by your store

When the clock strikes two
There's so much to do
And I cant explain what I need

Jobs and social groups
Hearing the latest news
Keeping your reputation clean

And I don't wanna worry
About being on time
I see the way you hurry
And time runs your life again

The difference between east and west
Money means so much less
And objects aren't so important to buy

I wish that earth clock
Could often just be stopped
And then we look into the time

And I don't wanna worry
About being on time
I see the way you hurry
And time runs your life again

Why can't people just understand
money's something in the nature of the hand
now as we need something to help us with
all used up and nothing more to give

Change for the better
no more laziness kills like murder
help another you want for someday
you cant hide while I'm running

And all these people they don't comprehend
all those obscure animals aren't even in their pen
along the wheels comes the pain and strife,
?

what were doing here, now no one knows
the thoughts, the things that i dont know
images all but a mind blur
your laughter has drived you here
you can do what you want to
i need some time alone
between what answers there is
i need some time alone
dont talk to me
dont notice me
dont talk to me
dont notice me

images all but a mind blur
your laughter has drived you here
not in the mood, not just to justify
and not to think of what a lie
you can do what you want to
i need some time alone
between what answers there is
i need some time alone
dont talk to me
dont notice me
dont talk to me

Two different people, two different places
Through a one way window with two different faces
Agreements are not reached, faces are forgotten
The other person's shoes, you've not got in

Stubborn minded enclosed to your own world
Wake up and see someone else's morals
What right to you
Might be true

It's a different point of view to you
You cannot see things that are different to me
And I can't understand why you cannot see
The things that I cannot see

I see what you don't see
I see what you don't see
Turn around and the shadows are all around me

Two different people, two different places
Through a one way window with two different faces
Agreements are not reached, faces are forgotten
The other person's shoes, you've not got in

I whistle good
I'm kinda straight
And I can can can have fun

No matter what I do
I've always assumed that
I can't go on sucking on my thumb

Sifting through my toys
Resting at my door
After thinking that I couldn't read
Sitting on the porch
And waiting for porno
While sucking on my damn fugi

I don't know why
I just want to die
And here's 2 bucks for you
This is the part where I should really part
But I guess I've got nothing to do

I don't know why
I just want to die
And here's 2 bucks for you
This is the part where I should really part
But I guess I've got nothing to do

What'd our grandma think of me
All that I've got to do
Guess I should its a wonder

My breath
its how the streets cave in everyday

Oh how the antelopes
Tom's thumb just walked right through my nose

What'd our grandma think of me
All that I've got to do
Guess I should its a wonder

In the darkest tunnel it's nice to see a light
not just a headlight
like the one that's heading right for me
it would be nice if things could turn out right
turn out right yeah
don't think I'll ever see the day

I must have done something wrong
or maybe pissed off God
I think of Chinese food when I think of life
that's sweet and sour
my life is sweet as saccharine
you know three week old milk and grapes are not
not the same, no
I am the one Johnny Carcinogen

I must have fucked with some witch
in turn she cursed me, cursed my life
at the end of the longest line
that's where I will always be
if you need to find me, just go to
the end of the longest line

But officer that was a yellow light
the light was red, son
insubordination, reckless driving
I must be wrong, this can't be right
I don't belong, this world is much to dangerous
for someone lacking luck, like me

At the end of the longest line
that's where I will always be
if you need to find me, just go to
the end of the longest line
at the end of the longest line
that's where I will always be
at the end of the longest line

Seen enough to eye you
but I've seen to much to try you
it's always weirdness while you
dig too much to fry you
the weirdness flows between us
freak scene just can't believe us
why can't it be cool and free us

Seen enough to eye you

it's always weirdness while you
dig too much to fry you
the weirdness flows between us
freak scene just can't believe us
why can't it be cool and free us

It's so fucked, I can't believe it
if there's a way I wish I'd see it
how could it work, just can't conceive us
oh what a mess it's just to leave it

Sometimes I don't thrill you
sometimes I think I'll kill you
just don't let me fuck up will you
cause when I need a friend it's still you.

I talk to you every now and then
I never felt so alone again
I stop to think at a wishing well
My thoughts send me on a carousel

Here I am standing on my own
Not a motion from the telephone
I know not a reason why
Solitudes a reason to die

Just you wait and see
As school life is a
It is a woken dream
Aren't you feeling alone?

I guess its just another
I guess its just another
I guess its just another night alone

Now as I walk down the street
I need a job just to sleep in sheets
Buying food every once in a while
But not enough to purchase a smile

A tank of gas is a treasure to me
I know now that nothing is free
I talk to you every now and then
I never felt so alone again

Just you wait and see
As school life is a
It is a woken dream
Aren't you feeling alone?

I guess its just another
I guess its just another
I guess its just another night alone

When I'm at work, ya, I always rush right home for lunch
So I can check out what's up on the Brady Bunch
And when I'm walking through the front door at night
I gotta see who's winning on The Price is Right, oh

I never dreamed that I'd spend my days
Staring at some tube emitting cathode rays
I need my TV

What's happening in this world, I don't care at all
But it better not pre-empt Monday Night Football
I can't even come up with my own views
I'm taught how to think from the evening news, oh

I never dreamed that I'd spend my days
Staring at some tube emitting cathode rays
I need my TV

La la la...

I would do anything and that's
What scares me so bad
Don't want to live my life alone
Don't want to go back to what I had

Don't want to spend my life without
All those special things
Don't want to walk around being tied to
Anyone else's

Strings, strings, strings, strings

I would do anything and that's
What scares me so bad
Don't want to live my life alone
Don't want to go back to what I had

Don't want to spend my life without
All those special things
Don't want to walk around being tied to
Anyone else's

Strings, strings, strings, strings
Strings, strings, strings, strings

At the risk of sounding rude
Just who the fuck do you think you are
To tell me what you expect of me today?

Well, you can take your attitude
You're out of luck, you've gone way too far
If you think there's any chance I'm gonna stay

How long can I string you along?
How little of myself can I give
And still make you believe I care?

At the risk of sounding trite
Why the fuck do you think you're right
About every little thing that you say?

And do you think that it is right
For Tom to spend another night
Writing songs about all the people he thinks are gay?

How long can I string you along?
How little of myself can I give
And still make you believe I care?

How long can I string you along
How little of myself can I give
And still make you believe I care?

Walking through the grass
Another blade next to you from the ground
As the wind does pass
I notice as you feel the breath of my shout

Your words are kind
The kind that repeatedly say no
But that's alright
I'm older than you so I've got time

What have you said, reach out your hand
There's a black shadow on my wall
But as I look into my mind
I can see that girls are a waste of time

We've all seen the bridge
A broken seam and a girl on one side
You think your words will work
They only work when you lay down and close your eyes

I thought of all the lines
All the right ones used at all the wrong times
But that's alright
Depression's just a sarcastic state of mind

What have you said, reach out your hand
There's a black shadow on my wall
But as I look into my mind
I can see that girls are a waste of time

I don't want to live alone
I don't want to live in
My broken dreams of you

I don't want to live along with
My broken dreams of you
I don't want to live along with
My broken dreams of you

My mind wanders as I'm trying not to fall in love with you
'Cause every time I wake I ponder on my mistakes of
What I said, it is always my esteem that I sure lose
Playing those stupid games as I always end up chasing you

I can't help myself anymore
Rehearsing my thoughts as I'm too scared to come to your door
I pushed it all aside just to stand next to you
Now you won't talk to me for something that I didn't do
It's not going to work

And I'm trying not to think of you
I'm all confused as I think of the things that I would do
I'm all shook up as I get all nervous inside
My emotions are something that I will always hide

Oh, how I wish that they would last
Moments of peace that just slip through me so fast
Just when I think that they are gonna stay
Everything inside me just starts fading away

Sometimes it seems like all I hope for
Just gets thrown down on the floor
And then it seems like you don't love me anymore
Sometimes I wish that I could run away
Sometimes I wish I just had something to say

She looks at me and doesn't know the words to say
But it's not you, I just don't feel quite right today
All these things I say and do were never planned
But how the fuck am I supposed to make you understand that

Sometimes it seems like all I hope for
Just gets thrown down on the floor
And then it seems like you don't love me anymore
Sometimes I wish that I could run away
Sometimes I wish I just had something to say

I'm gonna wanna see myself with someone too
Friends I don't pay are friends i never knew
So I took the chance and got some help from a few
And got a long and skinny friend to talk to

Cause I have the time and the liberty
To play with my pet sally
Please don't go away, sally please

No more lonely showers and uneaten foods
My salamander has hygiene too
And he thinks of me the way I think of you
The only next step is for him to say I do

Sally please don't go away
I won't be living in yesterday
The lonely nights
Getting beat up by gays in bar fights

Do you wanna know what I think of you?
'Cause you're not the way I thought you should be
Do take back what you said
It's time to fix, it's time to fix your head

And now all alone, one's less than two
I've never been better off living lonely
To listen to what you say
I couldn't care less of what you say

What did you think of me acting this way
I guess you never really thought at all
Is that what you call your brain?
Is that why I call you hang up on me?

I wanted to know, I didn't want to lose
And now I'm a man who's just living small
Listen to what you say
I couldn't care less of what you say

To me as I walk alone I'd
Much rather be riding prone, then
To be just another one you are lame to

I wanted to know, I didn't want to lose
But now I'm a man who's just living small
Listen to what you say
I couldn't care less of what you say

To me as I tune you out of my mind
Won't bend over backwards or
Take another step ahead to
Hear from you again

Don't talk to me as I walk alone, I'd
Much rather be riding prone, than
Be just another one you are lame to

Don't talk to me as I tune you out of my mind
Won't bend over backwards or
Take another step ahead to
Hear from you again

Don't talk to me as I walk alone, I'd
Much rather be riding prone, than
To be just another one you are lame to

White girl living in the big city
In a big apartment house
She's living with her boyfriend now

She drives off every day for school and work
She washes dishes now
And watches tv on the pull out couch

And every day's the same

White girl moved back to the suburbs
And she finally found a man
Who knows how to take care of her

She bought the perfect little house
And the lawn's well manicured
And she'd never missed a day of work

And every day's the same

White girl couldn't go on knowing
She was just here wasting her time
She drowned in the lake last night

They found her bloated body floating
But she still walks around
Performing all her daily chores

She still don't know what life's about

Cause every day's the same
And she's got no one to love

There was a time long ago
But it seemed like yesterday
When all I wanted was you
And now you make a segway
As you turn your face away
And I know your words aren't true

And I don't want your lies
And I don't think that I'm
better than you inside

And you can take off your disguise
Cause I can see the truth that's hidden
Behind your eyes

And all those words that you don't say
just mean less and less each day
you can't make me shed a tear

I think about tomorrow
Another day of sorrow
But I don't think that I'll be here

You and I should get away for awhile
I just want to be alone with your smile
Buy some candy and cigarettes and we'll get in my car
We'll blast the stereo and we'll drive to Madagascar

Because when I'm with you there's nothing I wouldn't do
I just want to be your only one
I'm grasping out at straws thinking back to what I saw
That night on the floor when we were all alone

My love life was getting so bland
There are only so many ways I can make love with my hand
Sometimes it makes me want to laugh
Sometimes I want to take my toaster in the bath

Because when I'm with you there's nothing I wouldn't do
I just want to be your only one
I'm grasping out at straws thinking back to what I saw
That night on the floor when we were all alone

Who's gonna be the odd man out?
I don't want to be the odd man out
Is this going to be the end
Or are you going to be my new girlfriend?

There's this one guy
There's no one like him in all the world
'Cause you can always see
Those girls down on there knees

In those dark sweaty rooms
Planning out his thoughts
He's waiting for just the right

One by one as they
Walk right through the door, they
Keep on coming back I
Guess they just want more

He has fun fun fun and you
Might call him a whore, but
Just look where he's at 'cause
He is the one that scores

I saw my friend there
Out on the field today
I asked him where he's going, he said
"All the way," now

One by one as they
Walk right through the door, they
Keep on coming back I
Guess they just want more

He has fun fun fun and you
Might call him a whore, but
Just look where he's at 'cause
He is the one that scores

I know what it's like to be alone sitting in your room
Listening to all the doubts that your parents have to say to you

And as your head gets all cluttered inside
Try to stay awake
Everything they say are lies
That's all the shit that you ever have to take

So hold in all your aggresions
Because your grinding your teeth on down to
The bottom of your chin

It's not easy or so damn pleasing
To not laugh at everything they say that
They tell you what to be you're not alone

I know what it's like to be denied at everything you do
It's not the same reason why that
Makes you change the things that you once knew

As your head gets all cluttered inside
Give more than you take
Everything they say are lies
That's all the shit that you ever have to take

So hold in all your aggresions
Because your grinding your teeth on down to
The bottom of your chin

It's not easy or so damn pleasing
To not laugh at everything they say that
They tell you what to be you're not alone

You say you want to take off your shoes and
Walk barefoot down the street
Just to be the things that you can be
Just live for one more week (Go!)

You say you want to take off your shoes just to
Walk barefoot down the street
Just to be the things that you can be
Just live for one more week

So hold in all your aggresions
Because your grinding your teeth on down to
The bottom of your chin

It's not easy or so damn pleasing
To not laugh at everything they say that
They tell you what to be you're not alone

Who makes up all the rules about those girls I want?
Who tells them all to laugh?
Who tells them all to talk about me?

And I'm not sure what my purpose is for being here
Why do they, why do they
Always kick me in the groin when I come near

And I'm not complaining it just hurts after a bit.

I don't know what I'm feeling
I'm just so sick of seeing
All those dumb, lame, and retarded broads

Who often just sit kick back
As I am not so relaxed
I often wonder why they act so odd

Because no worse a time
When it's just your time to
Think you should make your move
It doesn't work as your just a jerk with no excuse

What about that situation
All night procrastination
Takes you to the point when you lead her to her door

There is nothing left there to say
I guess you best be on your way
But before you go you got to do that chore

No worse a time
When it's just your time to
Think you should make your move
It doesn't work as your just a jerk with no excuse

Please won't you buy in
I'm always tryin'
I keep on tryin'
There's only so much pride that I can lose

I hope that when you see me
You see right through me
Come on now, honestly
I'm so sick of endin' up without a clue

When you talk about tomorrow
I'm not sure about today
When you tell me that you love me
What am I supposed to say?

Sometimes I don't feel
The same way as you feel

Words like forever
They scare the shit out of me
Maybe I'm afraid of commitment
Maybe you're too distracted to see that

Sometimes I don't feel
The same way as you feel

I think of all the things I'd say to you if I had the chance again
I think of all the things I'd scream
But I think it's for the best
That you and I just don't connect and
Things are never quite what they seem

Will there ever be
Someone to give her heart to me
Or would I be to blind to see it

I wouldn't make a sound
I'd keep it underground

It always seems like I'm running around around
Running around around
Round

Sometimes I don't feel
The same way as you feel

I'm wasting time thinking about a girl
And stealing her away from her world
She and I would run away
I think of all the things that I'd say

We'd talk about important things
And I picture it in my dreams
She'd teach me about modern art
And I'd show her it's okay to fart and

Maybe I'd impress her
By being in a band and
Maybe if I act real tough
She'd let me hold her hand and
Maybe I'll win her heart
By writing this song about her

Sometimes I sit at home and
Wonder if she's sitting at home
Thinking of me and wondering if I'm
Sitting at home, thinking about her
Or am I just wasting my time

Remembering how she laughed at Kinko's
When I made fun of that guy
Remebering the look she gave me
When I told her that I used to fry

I really want to ask her out
But my ego could never take it
And even if I got the balls
You know that the Cougar would never make it

And in my town you can't drive naked

And maybe I'd impress her
By being in a band and
Maybe if I act real tough
She'd let me hold her hand and
Maybe I'll win her heart
By writing this song about her

Sometimes I sit at home and
Wonder if she's sitting at home
Thinking of me and wondering if I'm
Sitting at home, thinking about her
Or am I just wasting my time

Am I just wasting my time
Am I just wasting my time
Am I just wasting my time
Wasting my time thinking about a girl

Walking through the grass
Another blade next to you from the ground
As the wind does pass
I notice as you feel the breath of my shout

Your words are kind

I don't want to live alone
I don't want to live in
My broken dreams of you

I don't want to live along with
My broken dreams of you
I don't want to live along with
My broken dreams of you

(No we ain't gonna take it unless it's from a doverman pincher
Ladies and gentlemen, for your listening pleasure, Blink)

Passively one day as the sun rose out of it's house
So did this little old guy as he whistled out of his mouth
And happily and gay
Well I guessed exactly that
Because he found a special girl
That put him in a special trance

He fell in love so quickly
What the hell was he to expect
That the girl under his arm wasn't the same
As any other girl
That he had thought that he once met
I guess you could only blame fate

Things started getting weird as they started to kiss
She often felt his beard and remembered how her father she missed
And then quietly one day
He sang a song from deep within his heart
Causing some ingestion
He finished with a great big fart and

She knew at that one moment
That song was something she heard before
So she asked him to do that again

Then out the door they hurried
She was gonna find out for sure
So she analyzed his rear end

She said, "When I was a little girl my dad left my mom.
He used to always fart and sing this special song.
Now I wasn't quite so sure until your pants did fall.
'Cause now I know that your my dad because you use ben wah balls."

I said a wah, wah, wah-wah-wah,
Wah, wah-wah-wah, wah...
Ben wah ball wah, wah, wah-wah-wah,
Wah, wah-wah-wah, wah...

Just about done with your butt we'll let you know, hey [4x]
Just about done with your butt
Just about done with your butt we'll let you know
Just about done with your butt we'll let you know, hey [3x]
Just about done with your butt [2x]
Just about done with your butt we'll let you know,hey [2x]
Just about done, hey
Just about done with your butt
Just about done with your butt we'll let you know, hey

I don't want to urinate on myself
I don't want to urinate on anyone else
Well, I guess that really doesn't matter anymore
Because I can't control my bladder anymore

Well, I guess it all depends (undergarments)
Well, I guess it all depends (undergarments)

Step back in the light
No more soiled nights alone
But I guess I don't have a care
Because there's not a load in my underwear

I'm sick of offending everyone I meet (go, go, go, go)
I'm sick of crying myself to sleep on rubber sheets (go)
I had an accident today
I left a soil on a bus seat, I didn't know what to say

But, I guess it all depends (undergarments)
Well, I guess it all depends (undergarments)

Step back into life (go, go)
No more soiled nights alone
Well, I guess that I don't have a care
If I don't have a load in my underwear

I know I'm pathetic, I knew when she said it
A loser, a bum's what she called me when I drove her home
There's no more waiting and sure no more wasting
I've done all I can but she still wants to be left alone

You got, you got, you got to help me out
And I'll try not to argue
No one, no one, no one likes a drop-out
Mistakes are hard to undo

Don't pull me down, this is where I belong
I think I'm different, but I'm the same and I'm wrong
Don't pull me down, this is where I belong
I think I'm different, this is where I belong

I think it's disgusting, believing and trusting
If I gave a fuck there would be nothing for me to prove
Although it's amusing, it's slightly confusing
I've done all I can but her ego is still hard to move

You got, you got, you got to help me out
And I'll try not to argue
No one, no one, no one likes a drop-out
Mistakes are hard to undo

Don't pull me down, this is where I belong
I think I'm different, but I'm the same and I'm wrong
Don't pull me down, this is where I belong
I think I'm different, this is where I belong

Don't pull me down, this is where I belong
I think I'm different, this is where I belong

And when the day ends I'm sure she feels sorrow
The lonely guy I am, I wait for her to change
I've been here two days, I'll sure be here tomorrow
I'd eat her out if she were on my dinner plate

And I wish
I wish she'd be more kind now
I'm out of luck 'cause the shades are pulled down
I've seen everything there is to be shown
I followed her all the way home

I can't be too cool in a tree with my pants down
The air is cold and I've got splinters in my feet
She caught me once, but I don't think that she cares now
Unlike before, her view is now blocked by a leaf

And I wish
I wish she'd be more kind now
I'm out of luck 'cause the shades are pulled down
I've seen everything there is to be shown
I followed her all the way home

I bet this last time's the one time too many
The rush of waiting is burning through my head
Right after supper her brother showers twice a week
He kicks my ass so much, that filthy white inbred

I've made mistakes by looking in the wrong window
Her dad is big and I've never seen his face
I've been here two days, and I'll sure be here tomorrow
My lady's so sweet, she likes to entertain

And I wish
I wish she'd be more kind now
I'm out of luck 'cause the shades are pulled down
I've seen everything there is to be shown
I followed her all the way home

I bet this last time's the one time too many
The rush of waiting is burning through my head
Right after supper her brother showers twice a week
He kicks my ass so much, that filthy white inbred

It's alright
to tell me
what you think
about me
I won't try
to argue
or hold it
against you
I know that
you're leaving
you must have
your reasons
The season
is calling
and your pictures
are falling down

The steps that
I retrace
the sad look
on your face
The timing
and structure
did you hear
he fucked her?
A day late
a buck short
I'm writing
the report
On losing
and failing
when I move
I'm flailing now

And it's happened once again
I'll turn to a friend
Someone that understands
Sees through the master plan

But everybody's gone
And I've been here for too long
To face this on my own
Well I guess this is growing up

Well I guess this is growing up

And maybe
I'll see you
at a movie
sneak preview
You'll show up
and walk by
on the arm
of that guy
And I'll smile
and you'll wave
we'll pretend
it's okay
The charade
it won't last
when he's gone
I won't come back

And it'll happen once again
You'll turn to a friend
Someone that understands
And sees through the master plan

But everybody's gone
And you've been there for too long
To face this on your own
Well I guess this is growing up

Well, I guess this is growing up [4x]
Well, I guess this is growing up

You don't need nothin'
And I know that you won't even try
Don't wait for me to help you
Too late for any of my advice

No trust
All I got is lies
Boring
Alright

Misplaced your values
Forgot being the importance of being right
Don't sit there and act humble
I've heard your story a thousand times

No trust
All I got is lies
Boring
Alright

Please, mom
You ground me all the time
I know that I was right
All along

And I'm hoping
Remember I'm a kid
I know not what I did
Just having fun

You couldn't wait for something new
And yesterday I thought of you
It left me to think as if I couldn't walk away
It's too late, I fell through

Nothing to lose
A boy who went out when he finished all his chores
Nothing to do
They can't trust me because I blew it once before

Shit, dad
Please don't kick my ass
I know I've seen you trashed
At least one time

Can I blame it
On one of my dumb friends
It's been awhile
Since I have used that line

You couldn't wait for something new
And yesterday I thought of you
It left me to think as if I couldn't walk away
It's too late, I fell through

Nothing to lose
A boy who went out when he finished all his chores
Nothing to do
They can't trust me because I blew it once before

(Alright)

Nothing to lose
A boy who went out when he finished all his chores
Nothing to do
They can't trust me because I blew it once before

Watching your house shrink away in my rear-view mirror
As I drive away
Wishing that I could take back all those words
That meant nothing that I didn't say

I'm trying
To be what you want me to be
But it's so damn hard to keep playing the part
Of the fool, week after week

I think you need some time alone (I think you need some time alone)
You say you want someone to call your own
Open your eyes, you can suck in your pride
You can live your life all on your own

Is this all going to be just another time
That we play this game?
I've tried to convince you that things could be different
But somehow they end up the same

But what
Did you expect from me? What am I supposed to do?
You say that you're starting to feel like you're getting lost
Well, I do, too

I don't wanna live this lie again (I don't wanna live this lie again)
I know I'll get it right but I don't know when
I'll open my eyes, I've got something in side
I'll just jack off in my room until then

It's never over 'til it's done
And I don't think that you're the one
It's never over 'til it's done
And I don't think that you're the one

Am I strung out, crazy, or not allowed
To be the one who gets stupid over you
Lazy (lazy), laid back (laid back), maybe you're just on crack
Why am I the one who gets fucked up and confused?
(Go)

She doesn't care at all
She doesn't care at all
She doesn't care about those times we never shared at all

If I were the last of the few who always ask
Would you still be the same person that I knew
And if it's for me, another boring story
I swear I'll act enthused

I think of awhile ago
We might have had it all
But I was so stupid then
You needed time to grow

But now just as things change
As well my feelings do
In time things rearrange
I am so sick of chasing you

But what do I get 'cause I just seem to lose
You make me regret those times I spent with you
And playing those games as I wait for your call
And now I give up, so goodbye and so long

It's not a change of pace
This time I'll get it right
It's not a change of taste
I was the one there last night

You have your other friends
They were there when you cried
Didn't mean to hurt you then
Best friends just won't leave your side

But what do I get 'cause I just seem to lose
You make me regret those times I spent with you
And playing those games as I wait for your call
And now I give up, so goodbye and so long

It's not a change of pace
This time I'll get it right
It's not a change of taste
I was the one there last night

When I needed you most
When I needed a friend
You let me down now
Like I let you down then

So sorry, it's over
(Ahh...)

She didn't mean to deceive you, believe me
But sometimes the hardest part is conceiving

The good intentions that you had
Now only came to this
And although she saw the mark
The arrow missed

It isn't exciting reciting the stories
Of kind words turned hurting when routine get boring

Both getting tired of punk rock clubs
And both playing in punk rock bands
The start was something good
But some good things must end

And she said, "It could never survive
With such differing lives
One home, one out on tour again

We may never come back
The strike of a match
The candle's buring at both ends."

And now she knows too much
And I'm too fucked up
It's awkward trying to make my move

I'll pretend that I'm fine
Show up right on time
But I know I'll never be that cool

I never wanted to hold you back
I just wanted to hold on
But my chance is gone

I know
just where
I stand
a boy
Trapped in the body of a man and

I'll take what you're willing to give
And I'll teach myself to live
With a walk-on part of a background shot
From a movie I'm not in

She's so important
And I'm so retarded

And now I realize
I should have kissed you in L.A.
But I drove home all alone
As if I had a choice, anyway

Where are you coming from?
What are you running from?
Is it so hard to see?

And if you're feeling scared
Remember the time we shared
You know it meant everything (everything)
You know that it meant everything to me

You know that it meant everything to me

One more time you will laugh about it
And he'll never try to give you more
And I don't care, he is such a dick
Treats you like you are a stupid whore

And it seems like things will never change
You go on, every cloud is in your way
And I know you feel empty all the time
You'll never listen to anything that I say

She's better off sleeping on the floor
'Cause she fell right off when all
Is said, you know
It's okay to just want more

Why leave when you claim it is love?
But why stay when you're not the only one?
She's proved she's strong
Be brave, be strong

She's better off sleeping on the floor
'Cause she fell right off when all
Is said, you know
It's okay to just want more

She's better off sleeping on the floor
She's better off sleeping on the floor (Because she fell right off her bed)
She's better off sleeping on the floor
She's better off sleeping on the floor (Because she fell right off her bed)
She's better off sleeping on the floor
She's better off sleeping on the floor (Because she fell right off her bed)
She's better off sleeping on the floor
She's better off sleeping on the floor (Because she fell right off her bed)

Yeah, my girlfriend takes me home when I'm too drunk to drive
And she doesn't get all jealous when I hang out with the guys
She laughs at my dumb jokes when no one does
She brings me mexican food from Sombrero's just because
(Yeah, just because)

And my girlfriend likes U.L. and D.H.C.
And she's so smart and independent, I don't think she needs me
Quite half as much as I know I need her
I wonder why there's not another guy that she'd prefer

And when I feel like giving up
Like my world is falling down

I show up at 3am
She's still up watching Vacation, and I
See her pretty face
It takes me away to a better place and

(I know that everything [3x]) Everything's gonna be fine
(I know that everything [3x]) Everything's gonna be fine

Yeah, my girlfriend takes collect calls from the road
And it doesn't seem to matter that I'm lacking in the bulge
She laughs at my dumb jokes when no one does
She brings me mexican food from Sombrero's just because

And when I feel like giving up
Like my world is falling down

I show up at 3am
She's still up watching Vacation, and I
See her pretty face
It takes me away to a better place and

(I know that everything [3x]) Everything's gonna be fine
(I know that everything [3x]) Everything's gonna be fine
(I know that everything [3x]) Everything's gonna be fine
(I know that everything [3x]) Everything's gonna be fine

(I know that everything [3x]) Everything's gonna be fine
(I know that everything [3x]) Everything's gonna be fine
(I know that everything [3x]) Everything's gonna be fine
(I know that everything [3x]) Everything's gonna be fine

I've got her in my head
At night when I go to bed
And I know it sounds lame, but
She's the girl of my dreams

And of course I'd do anything for her
I'd search the moons of Endor
I'd even walk naked through
The deserts of Tatooine

Princess Leia, where are you tonight?
And who's laying there by your side?
Every night I fall asleep with you
And I wake up alone

And even though I'm not as cool as Han
I still want to be your man
You're exactly the kind of
Alderranian that I need

But when you were available, I was
Drinking Colt 45's with Lando
I was hanging out in the cantina
On Mos Eisley

Princess Leia, where are you tonight?
And who's laying there by your side?
Every night I fall asleep with you
And I wake up alone

Princess Leia [2x]

Princess Leia, where are you tonight?
And who's laying there by your side?
Every night I fall asleep with you
And I wake up alone

Crossed the street, naked at night
Bent over to show some moonlight
Pulled out some beer and I gulped it down
Nude in a gutter is how I was found

Thrown in the policecar and the door slammed
No noise, just silence, as I screamed, my dick was
Jammed, now in prison for one month, no one to see
All I got is a guy Ben Dover

Don't like hesh, don't like rap
Kicked ol' Sally 'cause she's fat
I'm a jerk, I'm a punk
Took a shower 'cause I stunk
Smoked a bong, killed a cat
Had my nuts attacked by rats
Dad got nude, I wore a thong
For a hobby I make bombs

Went to a farm to tip some cows
Forgot that I left my pants down
Bent over to pick them up
Felt a twelve gauge next to my hum-diddy-dum

The farmer took me to his house
Showed me the closet from the inside out
The police came, they took me away
Saw Ben Dover again and he's still gay

Don't like hesh, don't like rap
Kicked ol' Sally 'cause she's fat
I'm a jerk, I'm a punk
Took a shower 'cause I stunk
Smoked a bong, killed a cat
Had my nuts attacked by rats
Dad got nude, I wore a thong
For a hobby I make bombs

Don't like hesh, don't like rap
Kicked ol' Sally 'cause she's fat
I'm a jerk, I'm a punk
Took a shower 'cause I stunk
Smoked a bong, killed a cat
Had my nuts attacked by rats
Dad got nude, I wore a thong
For a hobby I make bombs

Don't bide your time
'Cause it is almost over
And I know you're down
And I'll see you around

And I know it hurts
But you're just getting older
And I know you'll win
You'll do it once again

Just yesterday
It always seemed like such a dream
We're unstoppable, indestructable
Nothing happens to our machine

And there's no harm
At least nothing I can see
As for you, not so true
You couldn't choose where his road would lead

What a loss
You just lost all your sleep
And we've always thought
That this could never happen, you see

That it's so hard
You gotta get up on your feet
'Cause the only way, I gotta say
Is to move on through the week

Don't bide your time
'Cause it is almost over
And I know you're down
And I'll see you around

And I know it hurts
But you're just getting older
And I know you'll win
You'll do it once again

Sorry [x16]
(Sorry...) Happened to you [x4]

Don't bide your time
'Cause it is almost over
And I know you're down
And I'll see you around

And I know it hurts
But you're just getting older
And I know you'll win
You'll do it once again

A freight train to the right, feeling that sting of pride
It's fucking with me, it's fucking with you
All's fair in love and war until you say it isn't but you're wrong

Words on the back of flyers, my clothes are in the dryer
It means nothing, nothing is changing
La familia is dead and gone, the children grew up and moved on

Is it too much to ask for the things to work out this time?
I'm only asking for what is mine
I wanted everything, I got it and now I'm gonna
Throw it away, I'll throw it away (yeah)

Prime select and a box of glazed, pulling fly-bys on days
When we were young and innocent
Elbow-drop Sundays when Mark Eaton got beat to shit

Laughing at the bands we hate, all the spots we used to skate
They're still there, but we've gone our own ways
I know it's for the best but sometimes I wonder
Will I ever have friends like you again?

Is it too much to ask for the things to work out this time?
I'm only asking for what is mine
I wanted everything, I got it and now I'm gonna
Throw it away, I'll throw it away (yeah)

Is it too much to ask for the things to work out this time?
I'm only asking for what is mine
I wanted everything, I got it and now I'm gonna
Throw it away, I'll throw it away (yeah)

You're gonna drown in the mess you make
Your self-inflicted hate
You turn your back on the friends you lose
When they don't follow all your rules

But people are what they wanna be
They're not lemmings to the sea
Maybe it's time you looked at yourself
And stop blaming life on someone else

It's understood, I said it many ways
Too scared to run, I'm too scared to stay
I said I'd leave, but I could never leave her
And if I did, you know I'd never cheat her
But this I ask, it's what I want to know
How would you feel, if I should choose to go
Another guy, you think it'd be unlikely
Another guy, you think he'd want to fight me

She's a dove, she's a fucking nightmare
Unpredictable, it was my mistake to stay here
On the go and it's way too late to play
I need a girl that I can train

I heard it once, I'm sure I heard it twice
My dad used to give me all of his advice
He would say you've got to turn your back and run now
Come on son, you haven't got a chance now

She's a dove, she's a fucking nightmare
Unpredictable, it was my mistake to stay here
On the go and it's way too late to play
I need a girl that I can train

She's a dove, she's a fucking nightmare
Unpredictable, it was my mistake to stay here
On the go and it's way too late to play
I need a girl that I can train

I need a girl that I can train
I need a girl that I can train

Turn your back and run now
You haven't got a chance now

I need a girl that I can train
I need a girl that I can train

Turn your back and run now
You haven't got a chance now

Don't leave me all alone
Just drop me off at home
I'll be fine, it's not the first
Just like last time but a little worse

And she said that I'm not the one that she thinks about
And she said it stopped being fun, I just bring her down
I said, "Don't let your future be destroyed by my past."
She said, "Don't let my door hit your ass."

One more chance I'll try this time
I'll give you yours, I won't take mine
I'll listen up, pretend to care
Go on ahead, I'll meet you there

And she said that I'm not the one that she thinks about
She said it stopped being fun, I just bring her down
I said, "Don't let your future be destroyed by my past."
She said, "Don't let my door hit your ass."

Let's try this one more time with feeling
One more time with feeling [3x]

She said that I'm not the one that she thinks about and
She said it stopped being fun, I just bring her down
I said, "Don't let your future be destroyed by my past."
She said, "Don't let my door hit your ass."

Don't leave me all alone
Just drop me off at home
And I'll be fine.

Hey mom there's something in the backroom
I hope it's not the creatures from above
You used to read me stories
As if my dreams were boring
We all know conspiracies are dumb

What if people knew that these were real
I'd leave my closet door open all night
I know the CIA would say
What you hear is all hearsay
I wish someone would tell me what was right

Up all night long
And there's something very wrong
And I know it must be late
Been gone since yesterday
I'm not like you guys
I'm not like you

I am still the skeptic yes you know me
Been best friends and will be till we die
I got an injection
Of fear from the abduction
My best friend thinks I'm just telling lies

Alright

Up all night long
And there's something very wrong
And I know it must be late
Been gone since yesterday
I'm not like you guys
I'm not like you

Dark and scary, ordinary,
Explanation, information,
Nice to know ya, paranoia
Where's my mother, biofather

Up all night long
And there's something very wrong
And I know it must be late
Been gone since yesterday
I'm not like you guys
Twelve majestic lies

Please take me by the hand
It's so cold out tonight
I'll put blankets on the bed
I won't turn out the light
Just don't forget to think about me
And I won't forget you
I'll write you once a week she said

Why does it feel the same
To fall in love or break it off
And if young love is just a game
Then I must have missed the kick off
Don't depend on me to ever follow through on anything
But I'd go through hell for you and

[Chorus:]
I haven't been this scared in a long time
And I'm so unprepared so here's your valentine
Bouquet of clumsy words, a simple melody
This world's an ugly place, but you're so beautiful to me

I'll think about the times
She kissed me after class
And she put up with my friends
I acted like an ass
I'd ditch my lecture to watch the girls play soccer
Is my picture still hanging in her locker?

I took her out. It was a Friday night
I wore cologne to get the feeling right
We started making out, and she took off my pants
But then I turned on the TV

And that's about the time she walked away from me
Nobody likes you when you're 23
And are still more amused by TV shows
What the hell is ADD?

My friends say I should act my age
What's my age again?
What's my age again?

Then later on, on the drive home
I called her mom from a pay phone
I said I was the cops, and your husband's in jail
This state looks down on sodomy

And that's about the time that bitch hung up on me
Nobody likes you when you're 23
And are still more amused by prank phone calls
What the hell is Call ID?

My friends say I should act my age
What's my age again?
What's my age again?

And that's about the time she walked away from me
Nobody likes you when you're 23
And you still act like you're in freshman year
What the hell is wrong with me?

My friends say I should act my age
What's my age again?
What's my age again?

That's about the time that she broke up with me
No one should take themselves so seriously
With many years ahead to fall in line
Why would you wish that on me?
I never wanna act my age
What's my age again?
What's my age again?

What's my age again?

Got a lotta heart ache
He's a fucking weasel
His issues make my mind ache
Want to make a deal

'Cause I love your little motions
You do with your pigtails
What a nice creation
Worth another night in jail

He's a player,
Diarrhea giver,
Tried to grow his hair
'Cause he's listening to Slayer

I would like to find him Friday night
Hanging out with mom and trying on his father's tights

Life just sucks,
I lost the one,
I'm giving up,
She found someone
There's plenty more,
Girls are such a drag

So all you little ladies
Be sure to choose the right guys
You'll come back to me maybe
I'll shower you with lies

Got a lotta heart ache
He's a fucking weasel
Decisions make my mind ache
Want to make a deal

Ease away the problems and the pain
The girl chose the guy who makes you want to kick and scream
All along, you wish that she would stay
Fuck the guy that took and ran away

He's a player,
Diarrhea giver,
Tried to grow his hair
'Cause he's listening to Slayer

I would like to find him Friday night
Hanging out with mom and trying on his father's tights

Life just sucks,
I lost the one,
I'm giving up,
She found someone
There's plenty more,
Girls are such a drag

Fuck this place,
I lost the war,
I hate you all,
Your mom's a whore
Where's my dog?
'Cause girls are such a drag

All the small things
True care, truth brings
I'll take one lift
Your ride best trip

Always I know
You'll be at my show
Watching, waiting, commiserating

Say it ain't so,
I will not go,
Turn the lights off,
Carry me home

Na, na...

Late night, come home
Work sucks, I know
She left me roses by the stairs,
Surprises, let me know she cares

Say it ain't so,
I will not go,
Turn the lights off,
Carry me home

Na, na...

Say it ain't so,
I will not go,
Turn the lights off,
Carry me home

Keep your head still,
I'll be your thrill,
The night will go on,
My little windmill

Say it ain't so,
I will not go,
Turn the lights off,
Carry me home

Keep your head still,
I'll be your thrill,
The night will go on,
The night will go on,
My little windmill

He pauses shaving and he tells himself that he is the bomb
She has her curlers set, her credit cards are paying the funds

He's not that old, I've been told a strong sexual goal
He goes out every day, she goes every way, oh, yeah
And they don't even care at all

She's open, waiting for more
And I know he's only looking to score
And it is way too unhealthy
Often they've typically
Been starved for attention before

She smokes a dozen, and he doesn't seem to notice the smell
He took the seat off his own bike because the way that it felt

He wants to bone, this I know, she is ready to blow
They go out every night, his pants are super tight, oh, yeah
And they don't even care at all

[2x]
She's open waiting for more
And I know he's only looking to score
And it is way too unhealthy
Often they've typically
Been starved for attention before

Let's take the boat out on the bay
Forget your job for just one day
I wish it didn't have to be so bad
It might be inappropriate because
Either way our band gets dropped, oh yeah
I wish it didn't have to be so bad

But I'd play with fire to break the ice
And I'd play with a nuclear device
Is it something I'll regret?
Why do I want what I can't get?
I wish it didn't have to be so bad

The three-date theory's getting old
Everyone's getting left out in the cold
I wish it didn't have to be so bad
So I'll see you with another guy
Who pretends not to hear you when you cry, oh yeah
I wish it didn't have to be so bad

But I'd play with fire to break the ice
And I'd play with a nuclear device
Is it something I'll regret?
Why do I want what I can't get?
I wish it didn't have to be so bad

I'll be moving on, moving on, moving on, and on, and on
Moving on, moving on, moving on, and on, and on

But I'd play with fire to break the ice
And I'd play with a nuclear device
Is it something I'll regret?
Why do I want what I can't get?
I wish it didn't have to be so bad
I wish it didn't have to be so bad
I wish it didn't have to be so bad
I wish it didn't have to be so bad

Home show, mom won't know
Run out the back door
He's passed out on the floor
Third time, been caught twice
Forgive our neighbor Bob
I think he humped the dog

But good things come to those who wait
'Cause she laid me
And mom and dad posses the key - instant slavery
No need explain the plan, no need to even bother
I'll pack my bags, I swear I'll run - wish my friends were 21

White lies, bloodshot eyes
Breath of alcohol, stole it from the mall
How's Chris marked with lipstick
Better call their fathers, sleeping with your daughters

But good things come to those who wait
'Cause she laid me
And mom and dad posses the key - instant slavery
No need explain the plan, no need to even bother
I'll pack my bags, I swear I'll run - wish my friends were 21

You don't belong, you left the kids to carry on
You planned their fall
To bad you're wrong
Don't need a mom dad slave drive song

I time bomb, I time bomb, I time bomb
I time bomb, I time bomb

Turn low the radio, I think I hear my dad
Yelling at the band

But good things come to those who wait
'Cause she laid me
And mom and dad posses the key - instant slavery
No need explain the plan, no need to even bother
I'll pack my bags, I swear I'll run - wish my friends were 21

You don't belong, you left the kids to carry on
You planned their fall
To bad you're wrong
Don't need a mom dad slave drive song

I time bomb, I time bomb, I time bomb
I time bomb, I time bomb, I time bomb
I time bomb, I time bomb, I time bomb

Everything has fallen to pieces
Earth is dying help me Jesus
We need guidance, we've been misled
Young and hostile, but not stupid

Corporate leaders, politicians
Kids can't vote, adults elect them
Laws that rule the school and workplace
Signs that caution, sixteen's unsafe

We really need to see this through
We never wanted to be abused
We'll never give up, it's no use
If we're fucked up you're to blame

Let this train wreck burn more slowly
Kids are victims in this story
Drown our youth with useless warnings
teenage rules they're fucked and boring

We really need to see this through
We never wanted to be abused
We'll never give up, it's no use
If we're fucked up you're to blame

Everything has fallen to pieces
Everything has fallen to pieces
Everything has fallen to pieces
Everything has fallen to pieces
Everything has fallen to ...

We really need to see this through
we never wanted to be abused
We'll never give up, it's no use
if we're fucked up you're to blame!

Josie
You're my source of most frustration
Forget when
I don't meet expectations
Everything you wished came true
In the end we all blamed you
Even though, as they all know, you weren't the only one (two three four)

Why do you still keep it around
When you know it brings me down
I'm hating everything
And I know that you dated other guys
But I got to wonder why
You'd leave it out for me

Why am I still hanging around
When I know it brings me down
I'm hating everything
And you are getting rides home in his car
You're making out in his front yard
I'm hating everything

Please don't remind me
Put your past behind me
It shines so bright it blinds me
I wish that this would end
And I am not fine
Last night I saw you online
Your screen name used to be mine
Why can't we just pretend?

And if we can have another day
I've got so much left to say
I'd tell you everything
And I'll laugh when I think about the past
When I see you after class you're hating everything

Please don't remind me
Put your past behind me
It shines so bright it blinds me
I wish that this would end
And I am not fine
Last night I saw you online
Your screen name used to be mine
Why can't we just pretend
[x2]

And she said
Na (x13)
"I just forgot you were there"
Na (x13)
"I just forgot you were there"
Na (x13)
"I just forgot you were there"
Na (x15)

Please don't remind me
Put your past behind me
It shines so bright it blinds me
I wish that this would end
And I am not fine
Last night I saw you online
Your screen name used to be mine
Why can't we just pretend
[x2]

And she said
Na na na na na

In the car I just can't wait,
to pick you up on our very first date
Is it cool if I hold your hand?
Is it wrong if I think it's lame to dance?
Do you like my stupid hair?
Would you guess that I didn't know what to wear?
I'm too scared of what you think
You make me nervous so I really can't eat

Let's go, don't wait, this night's almost over
Honest, let's make this night last forever
Forever and ever, let's make this last forever
Forever and ever, let's make this last forever

When you smile, I melt inside
I'm not worthy for a minute of your time
I really wish it was only me and you
I'm jealous of everybody in the room
Please don't look at me with those eyes
Please don't hint that you're capable of lies
I dread the thought of our very first kiss
A target that i'm probably gonna miss

Let's go, don't wait, this night's almost over
Honest, let's make this night last forever
Forever and ever, let's make this last forever
Forever and ever, let's make this last forever

Let's go, don't wait, this night's almost over
Honest, let's make, this night last forever
Forever and ever, let's make this last forever
Forever and ever, let's make this last forever
Forever and ever, let's make this last forever
Forever and ever, let's make this last forever

It's Christmas Eve and I've only wrapped two fuckin' presents
It's Christmas Eve and I've only wrapped two fuckin' presents
And I hate, hate, hate your guts
I hate, hate, hate your guts
And I'll never talk to you again
Unless your dad will suck me off
I'll never talk to you again
Unless your mom will touch my cock
I'll never talk to you again
Ejaculate into a sock
I'll never talk to you again
I'll never talk to you again

It's Labor day and my grandpa just ate seven fuckin' hotdogs
It's Labor day and my grandpa just ate seven fuckin' hotdogs
And he shit shit shits his pants
He's always fuckin' shittin' his pants
And I'll never talk to you again
Unless your dad will suck me off
I'll never talk to you again
Unless your mom will touch my cock
I'll never talk to you again
Ejaculate into a sock
I'll never talk to you again
I'll never talk to you again

Push it out, fake a smile
Avert disaster, just in time
I need a drink, cause in a while
Worthless answers from friends of mine
It's dumb to ask, cool to ignore
Girls possess me, but they're never mine
I made my entrance, avoided hazards
Checked my engine, I fell behind

I fell behind

She makes me feel like it's raining outside
And when the storm's gone I'm all torn up inside
I'm always nervous on, days like this like the prom
I get too scared to move, cause I'm a fuckin' boy

Remember when I was in the grocery store, now's my time
Lost the words, lost the nerve, lost the girl, left the line
I would wish upon a star, but that star, it doesn't shine
So read my book with a boring ending
A short story of a lonely guy

Who fell behind

She makes me feel like it's raining outside
And when the storm's gone I'm all torn up inside
I'm always nervous on, days like this like the prom
I get too scared to move, cause I'm a fuckin' boy

She makes me feel like it's raining outside
And when the storm's gone I'm all torn up inside
I'm always nervous on, days like this like the prom
I get too scared to move, cause I'm still just a stupid worthless boy

Hanging out behind the club on the weekend
Acting stupid, getting drunk with my best friends
I couldn't wait for the summer and the Warped Tour
I remember it's the first time that I saw her there

She's getting kicked out of school 'cause she's failing
I'm kinda nervous, 'cause I think all her friends hate me
She's the one, she'll always be there
She took my hand and I made it I swear

Because I fell in love with the girl at the rock show
She said, "What?" and I told her that I didn't know
She's so cool, gonna sneak in through her window
Everything's better when she's around
I can't wait 'til her parents go out of town
I fell in love with the girl at the rock show

When we said we were gonna move to Vegas
I remember the look her mother gave us
Seventeen without a purpose or direction
We don't owe anyone a fucking explanation

I fell in love with the girl at the rock show
She said, "What?" and I told her that I didn't know
She's so cool, gonna sneak in through her window
Everything's better when she's around
I can't wait 'til her parents go out of town
I fell in love with the girl at the rock show

Black and white picture of her on my wall
I waited for her call, she always kept me waiting
And if I ever got another chance I'd still ask her to dance
Because she kept me waiting

I fell in love with the girl at the rock show
She said, "What?" and I told her that I didn't know
She's so cool, gonna sneak in through her window
Everything's better when she's around
I can't wait 'til her parents go out of town
I fell in love with the girl at the rock show

With the girl at the rock show
With the girl at the rock show
(I'll never forget tonight)
With the girl at the rock show

It's hard to wake up, when the shades have been pulled shut
This house is haunted, it's so pathetic, it makes no sense at all
I'm ripe with things to say, the words rot and fall away
If this stupid poem could fix this home, I'd read it every day

So here's your holiday
Hope you enjoy it this time, you gave it all away
It was mine, so when you're dead and gone
Will you remember this night, twenty years now lost
It's not right

Their anger hurts my ears, been running strong for seven years
Rather than fix the problems, they never solve them, it makes no sense at all
I see them everyday, we get along so why can't they?
If this is what he wants, and it's what she wants, then why is there so much pain?

So here's your holiday
Hope you enjoy it this time, you gave it all away
It was mine, so when you're dead and gone
Will you remember this night, twenty years now lost
It's not right

So here's your holiday
Hope you enjoy it this time, you gave it all away
It was mine, so when you're dead and gone
Will you remember this night, twenty years now lost?
It's not right
It's not right
It's not right
It's not right

Breathing deeply, walking backwards
Finding strength to call and ask her
Roller Coaster favorite ride
Let me kiss you one last time

Leave me standing here, act like I'm not around
The coast will probably never clear, can I please go home now
I had that dream about you again
Where I wait outside until you let me in
And there I stay

Lay beside me and listen at the wall
We'll keep on lying until the summer comes
I had that dream about you again
Where you drive my car right off the fucking cliff

And now I'm breathing deeply, walking backwards
Finding strength to call and ask her
Roller Coaster favorite ride
Let me kiss you one last time

Make me promise that I will never tell
All I remember is the way her bedroom smelled
I had that dream about you again
Where I wait outside until you let me in

And now I'm breathing deeply, walking backwards
Finding strength to call and ask her
Roller Coaster favorite ride
Let me kiss you one last time good night

Good night

On and on, reckless abandon
Something's wrong, this is gonna shock them
Nothing to hold on to
We'll use this song to lead you on

I learned a lot today
Not sure if I'll get laid
Not sure if I'll fail or pass
Kissed every girl in class

Everybody would waste it all
To have a summer that they could call
A memory that's full of fun
Fucked up, when it's all done

On and on, reckless abandon
Something's wrong, this is gonna shock them
Nothing to hold on to
We'll use this song to lead you on
And break the truth with more bad news
We left a scar, size extra large

Sip a drink of the alcohol
End up kneeling in bathroom stalls
Eyes are red and my movements slow
Too high, got vertigo
He took a shit in the bathroom tub
And fed the dog the brownie drug
Tried hard to not get caught
He fucked a chick in a parking lot

On and on, reckless abandon
Something's wrong, this is gonna shock them
Nothing to hold on to
We'll use this song to lead you on
And break the truth with more bad news
We left a scar, size extra large

Break a window and bust a wall
Making fun of your friends mom
Turn the music up way too loud
Charge the pizza to the house
Everybody would waste it all
To have a summer that they could call
Memory that's full of fun
Fucked up when it's all done

On and on, reckless abandon
Something's wrong, this is gonna shock them
Nothing to hold on to
We'll use this song to lead you on
And break the truth with more bad news
We left a scar, size extra large

I never found out why you left him
But this answer begs that question
Too blind to see tomorrow
Too broke to beg or borrow
Young and stupid, left wide open
Hearts are wasted, lives are broken

One more point of contention
I need some intervention
Approached with vague intentions
Betray my short attention
Span the distance, bridge the border
Beg forgiveness, round the corner

Everytime I look for you the sun goes down
And I stumble when this whole thing runs aground
I left another message, you are never around
But everytime I look for you the sun goes down once more
Will the last one out, please shut the door

More time apart will give you
A few more months to argue
Is this to much to live through?
It always seems too far to drive
The point home, send more letters
Pray tomorrow, ends up better

Everytime I look for you, the sun goes down
And I stumble when the whole thing runs aground
I left another message, you are never around
But everytime I look for you the sun goes down once more
Will the last one out, please shut the door

I never did do anything that she asked
I never let what happened, stay in the past
I never did quite understand what she meant
In spite of everything, in spite of everything

Everytime I look for you the sun goes down
And I stumble when this whole thing runs aground
I left another message, you are never around
But everytime I look for you the sun goes down
And I stumble when this whole thing runs aground
I left another message, you are never around
But everytime I look for you the sun goes down

Mom and dad they quite don't understand it
All the kids they laugh as if they planned it
Why do girls wanna pierce their nose
And walk around in torn pantyhose, oh yeah

I like the ones who say they listen to the punk rock
I like the the kids who fight against how they were brought up
They hate the trends and think it's fucked to care
It's cool when they piss people off with what they wear, oh yeah

So give me one good reason
Why we need to be like them
Kids will have fun and offend
They don't want to and don't fit in

Hate the jocks, the preps, the hippie fuckin scumbags
Heavy metalers with their awful pussy hair bands
Counting seconds until we can get away
Ditching school almost every single day, oh yeah

So give me one good reason
Why we need to be like them
Kids will have fun and offend
They don't want to and don't fit in

So give me one good reason
Why we need to be like them
Kids will have fun and offend
They don't want to and don't fit in

Shut the fuck up she said, I'm going fucking deaf
You're always too loud, everything's too loud
Now that all my friends left, this place is fucking dead
I wanna move out, when can we move out? This shit has got to stop

I'll run away

Get the fuck up, she said your life is meaningless
it's going nowhere, you're going nowhere
you're just a fuck-up, she said I'll live alone instead
she said you don't care, I know I don't care

I'll never ask permission from you,
fuck off I'm not listening to you
I'm not coming home, I'm never going to come back home

I got too fucked up again, and passed out on the plane
Tried to forget you, i can't forget you
No sleep on this flight, I'll think about the nights
we had to get through, how did we get through?

I'll never ask permission from you,
fuck off I'm not listening to you
I'm not coming home, I'm never going to come back home

I'll run away
I think it's time that I should leave
I think it's time that I should leave
I think it's time that I should leave
I think it's time that I should leave

I'll never ask permission from you,
fuck off i'm not listening to you
I'm not coming home, I'm never going to come back home

I'll run away
I think it's time for me to leave
I think it's time for me to leave
I think it's time for me to leave
I think it's time for me to leave

Oh no it happened again
She's cool, she's hot, she's my friend
I'd drive for hours, it's so
You leave me nowhere to go

She's unstoppable, unpredictable
I'm so jaded, calculated, wrong

Please take me home, too late, it's gone
I bet you're sad, this is the best time we ever had

I hope, hope that it lasts
Give in, forget the past
Be strong when things fall apart
Honest this breaks my heart

She's unstoppable, unpredictable
I'm so jaded, calculated, wrong

Please take me home, too late, it's gone
I bet you're sad, this is the best time we ever had
Please take me home, too late, it's gone
I bet you're sad, this is the best time we ever had

Why did we have to go date?
It's too easy to complicate
Be strong when things fall apart
Be strong when things fall apart
Honest this breaks my heart
It's so hard

Let's go!

Please take me home, too late, it's gone
I bet you're sad, this is the best time we ever had
Please take me home, too late, it's gone
I bet you're sad, this is the best time we ever had

I'm sick of always hearing
All the sad songs on the radio
All day it is there to remind an over sensitive guy
That he's lost and alone, yeah

I hate our favorite restaurant, favorite movie, our favorite show
We would stay up all through the night
We would laugh and get high
And never answer the phone

I can't forgive
Can't forget
Can't give in what went wrong
Cause you said this was right
You fucked up my life

I'm sick of always hearing
Sappy love songs on the radio
This place is fucking cursed in it's plague
And I can never escape when my heart it explodes

I can't forgive
Can't forget
Can't give in what went wrong
Cause you said this was right
You fucked up my life

I'm kicking out fiercely at the world around me
What went wrong [x4]

I'm kicking

[tom]
I want to fuck a dog in the ass

[mark]
he wants to fuck a dog in the ass

[tom]
I wanna fuck a dog
That's right kids.

I tried to fuck your mom in the ass
Tried to fuck your dad in the ass

Aarrh me and me first mate asurvy cur

Tried to fuck a fucking pirate

[music continues]

[mark and tom]
We want to fuck a dog in the ass
We want to fuck a dog in the ass
wanna fuck a fucking dog

[mark]
fuck you

I guess its only the men
Who get fucked now and again
We take our chicks to the mall,
We wait in parking stalls
And when we come home too late,
She's pissed that she had to wait
And my excuse not to call,
It never worked at all

Time to wake up
Where's your daughter?
Hurt's to break up,
She was stronger
All my friends say,
Please don't love her
What did i gain?
Now i miss her so

I used to hate the lipstick
It stained and tasted so sick
The pantyhose and the bras,
She threw on my guitars
Shit fuck i made a mistake,
I thought i needed a break
The truth is i'm such a dick,
It's broke and can't be fixed

Time to wake up
Where's your daughter?
Hurt's to break up,
She was stronger
All my friends say,
Please don't love her
What did i gain?
Now i miss her so

If you wanna call it a heartache,
Then i shouldn't regret those things, i miss her
If you want the pain to go away,
Better suck up your pride and admit you lost her
Let her go, move on, let her go, move on, let her go

Time to wake up
Where's your daughter?
Hurt's to break up,
She was stronger
All my friends say,
Please don't love her
What did i gain?
Now i miss her so

Move on, let her go, move on, let her go,
move on, let her go, move on, let her go

It's mother's day
It's mother's day
It's mother's day
It's mother's day

I hear the phone, it rings so violently
Can't leave my room, can't breathe since she left me
I will admit I hate those things I said
Girls will always cry, guys will never admit they did

Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on

Don't tell me that it's over
I'm not used to this temptation
And when you come back running
There's no use for explanation
I think things are too hopeful
Even with my expert knowledge
Most girls do mean trouble
Because they are rarely honest

What's with the jokes, all the routines they play
Screw with my head, never cave until they get their way
Guys like to run, chicks love to yell, you see
Guys hate to fight, girls think it's therapy

Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on

Don't tell me that it's over
I'm not used to this temptation
And when you come back running
There's no use for explanation
I think things are too hopeful
Even with my expert knowledge

Unos, dos, tres, cuatro...

When you fucked Grandpa did he tell you that he loved you?
Did he hold you till the sun did rise and did he look into your eyes
And ask you to fellate him, and stick a finger or two in his ass

He seems like a total asshole, Grandpa is a total fucking asshole
Who would ever want a dirty, greasy finger in his ass?
He rubs his dick in broken glass.

When you fucked Grandpa did he kiss you soft and tender?
Did he tie your hands behind your head and was it on your mother's bed and...

This is fucking stupid, man!
I can't believe you'd have sex with your own grandfather.
I mean, you guys are related! What's he gonna do?
Take out his false teeth and just leave them on the side of your bed?
Man, you like to fuck him in the butt and then have people come in and watch and masturbate and cum all over the place.
This is stupid. I hate you all.
I'm not even gonna have sex with my mom tonight, man, this is stupid!
I hate you.
