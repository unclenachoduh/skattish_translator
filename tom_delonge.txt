You are better than me,girls,money,and everything I try to compete with you,
but you beat me at everything i do
I see in you the things that I would like to be
But im different from you,

So you will have to be like me!

I cannot be bought my personality is what I choose
I was brought up without a silver cup I wont
covet the things owned by you

For all the world material things are now more and more
jealousy for you and me
I won't covet the things owned by your store

When the clock strikes two
There's so much to do
And I cant explain what I need

Jobs and social groups
Hearing the latest news
Keeping your reputation clean

And I don't wanna worry
About being on time
I see the way you hurry
And time runs your life again

The difference between east and west
Money means so much less
And objects aren't so important to buy

I wish that earth clock
Could often just be stopped
And then we look into the time

And I don't wanna worry
About being on time
I see the way you hurry
And time runs your life again

Why can't people just understand
money's something in the nature of the hand
now as we need something to help us with
all used up and nothing more to give

Change for the better
no more laziness kills like murder
help another you want for someday
you cant hide while I'm running

And all these people they don't comprehend
all those obscure animals aren't even in their pen
along the wheels comes the pain and strife,
?

what were doing here, now no one knows
the thoughts, the things that i dont know
images all but a mind blur
your laughter has drived you here
you can do what you want to
i need some time alone
between what answers there is
i need some time alone
dont talk to me
dont notice me
dont talk to me
dont notice me

images all but a mind blur
your laughter has drived you here
not in the mood, not just to justify
and not to think of what a lie
you can do what you want to
i need some time alone
between what answers there is
i need some time alone
dont talk to me
dont notice me
dont talk to me

Two different people, two different places
Through a one way window with two different faces
Agreements are not reached, faces are forgotten
The other person's shoes, you've not got in

Stubborn minded enclosed to your own world
Wake up and see someone else's morals
What right to you
Might be true

It's a different point of view to you
You cannot see things that are different to me
And I can't understand why you cannot see
The things that I cannot see

I see what you don't see
I see what you don't see
Turn around and the shadows are all around me

Two different people, two different places
Through a one way window with two different faces
Agreements are not reached, faces are forgotten
The other person's shoes, you've not got in

I whistle good
I'm kinda straight
And I can can can have fun

No matter what I do
I've always assumed that
I can't go on sucking on my thumb

Sifting through my toys
Resting at my door
After thinking that I couldn't read
Sitting on the porch
And waiting for porno
While sucking on my damn fugi

I don't know why
I just want to die
And here's 2 bucks for you
This is the part where I should really part
But I guess I've got nothing to do

I don't know why
I just want to die
And here's 2 bucks for you
This is the part where I should really part
But I guess I've got nothing to do

What'd our grandma think of me
All that I've got to do
Guess I should its a wonder

My breath
its how the streets cave in everyday

Oh how the antelopes
Tom's thumb just walked right through my nose

What'd our grandma think of me
All that I've got to do
Guess I should its a wonder

In the darkest tunnel it's nice to see a light
not just a headlight
like the one that's heading right for me
it would be nice if things could turn out right
turn out right yeah
don't think I'll ever see the day

I must have done something wrong
or maybe pissed off God
I think of Chinese food when I think of life
that's sweet and sour
my life is sweet as saccharine
you know three week old milk and grapes are not
not the same, no
I am the one Johnny Carcinogen

I must have fucked with some witch
in turn she cursed me, cursed my life
at the end of the longest line
that's where I will always be
if you need to find me, just go to
the end of the longest line

But officer that was a yellow light
the light was red, son
insubordination, reckless driving
I must be wrong, this can't be right
I don't belong, this world is much to dangerous
for someone lacking luck, like me

At the end of the longest line
that's where I will always be
if you need to find me, just go to
the end of the longest line
at the end of the longest line
that's where I will always be
at the end of the longest line

Seen enough to eye you
but I've seen to much to try you
it's always weirdness while you
dig too much to fry you
the weirdness flows between us
freak scene just can't believe us
why can't it be cool and free us

Seen enough to eye you

it's always weirdness while you
dig too much to fry you
the weirdness flows between us
freak scene just can't believe us
why can't it be cool and free us

It's so fucked, I can't believe it
if there's a way I wish I'd see it
how could it work, just can't conceive us
oh what a mess it's just to leave it

Sometimes I don't thrill you
sometimes I think I'll kill you
just don't let me fuck up will you
cause when I need a friend it's still you.

I talk to you every now and then
I never felt so alone again
I stop to think at a wishing well
My thoughts send me on a carousel

Here I am standing on my own
Not a motion from the telephone
I know not a reason why
Solitudes a reason to die

Just you wait and see
As school life is a
It is a woken dream
Aren't you feeling alone?

I guess its just another
I guess its just another
I guess its just another night alone

Now as I walk down the street
I need a job just to sleep in sheets
Buying food every once in a while
But not enough to purchase a smile

A tank of gas is a treasure to me
I know now that nothing is free
I talk to you every now and then
I never felt so alone again

Just you wait and see
As school life is a
It is a woken dream
Aren't you feeling alone?

I guess its just another
I guess its just another
I guess its just another night alone

When I'm at work, ya, I always rush right home for lunch
So I can check out what's up on the Brady Bunch
And when I'm walking through the front door at night
I gotta see who's winning on The Price is Right, oh

I never dreamed that I'd spend my days
Staring at some tube emitting cathode rays
I need my TV

What's happening in this world, I don't care at all
But it better not pre-empt Monday Night Football
I can't even come up with my own views
I'm taught how to think from the evening news, oh

I never dreamed that I'd spend my days
Staring at some tube emitting cathode rays
I need my TV

La la la...

I would do anything and that's
What scares me so bad
Don't want to live my life alone
Don't want to go back to what I had

Don't want to spend my life without
All those special things
Don't want to walk around being tied to
Anyone else's

Strings, strings, strings, strings

I would do anything and that's
What scares me so bad
Don't want to live my life alone
Don't want to go back to what I had

Don't want to spend my life without
All those special things
Don't want to walk around being tied to
Anyone else's

Strings, strings, strings, strings
Strings, strings, strings, strings

At the risk of sounding rude
Just who the fuck do you think you are
To tell me what you expect of me today?

Well, you can take your attitude
You're out of luck, you've gone way too far
If you think there's any chance I'm gonna stay

How long can I string you along?
How little of myself can I give
And still make you believe I care?

At the risk of sounding trite
Why the fuck do you think you're right
About every little thing that you say?

And do you think that it is right
For Tom to spend another night
Writing songs about all the people he thinks are gay?

How long can I string you along?
How little of myself can I give
And still make you believe I care?

How long can I string you along
How little of myself can I give
And still make you believe I care?

Walking through the grass
Another blade next to you from the ground
As the wind does pass
I notice as you feel the breath of my shout

Your words are kind
The kind that repeatedly say no
But that's alright
I'm older than you so I've got time

What have you said, reach out your hand
There's a black shadow on my wall
But as I look into my mind
I can see that girls are a waste of time

We've all seen the bridge
A broken seam and a girl on one side
You think your words will work
They only work when you lay down and close your eyes

I thought of all the lines
All the right ones used at all the wrong times
But that's alright
Depression's just a sarcastic state of mind

What have you said, reach out your hand
There's a black shadow on my wall
But as I look into my mind
I can see that girls are a waste of time

I don't want to live alone
I don't want to live in
My broken dreams of you

I don't want to live along with
My broken dreams of you
I don't want to live along with
My broken dreams of you

My mind wanders as I'm trying not to fall in love with you
'Cause every time I wake I ponder on my mistakes of
What I said, it is always my esteem that I sure lose
Playing those stupid games as I always end up chasing you

I can't help myself anymore
Rehearsing my thoughts as I'm too scared to come to your door
I pushed it all aside just to stand next to you
Now you won't talk to me for something that I didn't do
It's not going to work

And I'm trying not to think of you
I'm all confused as I think of the things that I would do
I'm all shook up as I get all nervous inside
My emotions are something that I will always hide

Oh, how I wish that they would last
Moments of peace that just slip through me so fast
Just when I think that they are gonna stay
Everything inside me just starts fading away

Sometimes it seems like all I hope for
Just gets thrown down on the floor
And then it seems like you don't love me anymore
Sometimes I wish that I could run away
Sometimes I wish I just had something to say

She looks at me and doesn't know the words to say
But it's not you, I just don't feel quite right today
All these things I say and do were never planned
But how the fuck am I supposed to make you understand that

Sometimes it seems like all I hope for
Just gets thrown down on the floor
And then it seems like you don't love me anymore
Sometimes I wish that I could run away
Sometimes I wish I just had something to say

I'm gonna wanna see myself with someone too
Friends I don't pay are friends i never knew
So I took the chance and got some help from a few
And got a long and skinny friend to talk to

Cause I have the time and the liberty
To play with my pet sally
Please don't go away, sally please

No more lonely showers and uneaten foods
My salamander has hygiene too
And he thinks of me the way I think of you
The only next step is for him to say I do

Sally please don't go away
I won't be living in yesterday
The lonely nights
Getting beat up by gays in bar fights

Do you wanna know what I think of you?
'Cause you're not the way I thought you should be
Do take back what you said
It's time to fix, it's time to fix your head

And now all alone, one's less than two
I've never been better off living lonely
To listen to what you say
I couldn't care less of what you say

What did you think of me acting this way
I guess you never really thought at all
Is that what you call your brain?
Is that why I call you hang up on me?

I wanted to know, I didn't want to lose
And now I'm a man who's just living small
Listen to what you say
I couldn't care less of what you say

To me as I walk alone I'd
Much rather be riding prone, then
To be just another one you are lame to

I wanted to know, I didn't want to lose
But now I'm a man who's just living small
Listen to what you say
I couldn't care less of what you say

To me as I tune you out of my mind
Won't bend over backwards or
Take another step ahead to
Hear from you again

Don't talk to me as I walk alone, I'd
Much rather be riding prone, than
Be just another one you are lame to

Don't talk to me as I tune you out of my mind
Won't bend over backwards or
Take another step ahead to
Hear from you again

Don't talk to me as I walk alone, I'd
Much rather be riding prone, than
To be just another one you are lame to

White girl living in the big city
In a big apartment house
She's living with her boyfriend now

She drives off every day for school and work
She washes dishes now
And watches tv on the pull out couch

And every day's the same

White girl moved back to the suburbs
And she finally found a man
Who knows how to take care of her

She bought the perfect little house
And the lawn's well manicured
And she'd never missed a day of work

And every day's the same

White girl couldn't go on knowing
She was just here wasting her time
She drowned in the lake last night

They found her bloated body floating
But she still walks around
Performing all her daily chores

She still don't know what life's about

Cause every day's the same
And she's got no one to love

There was a time long ago
But it seemed like yesterday
When all I wanted was you
And now you make a segway
As you turn your face away
And I know your words aren't true

And I don't want your lies
And I don't think that I'm
better than you inside

And you can take off your disguise
Cause I can see the truth that's hidden
Behind your eyes

And all those words that you don't say
just mean less and less each day
you can't make me shed a tear

I think about tomorrow
Another day of sorrow
But I don't think that I'll be here

You and I should get away for awhile
I just want to be alone with your smile
Buy some candy and cigarettes and we'll get in my car
We'll blast the stereo and we'll drive to Madagascar

Because when I'm with you there's nothing I wouldn't do
I just want to be your only one
I'm grasping out at straws thinking back to what I saw
That night on the floor when we were all alone

My love life was getting so bland
There are only so many ways I can make love with my hand
Sometimes it makes me want to laugh
Sometimes I want to take my toaster in the bath

Because when I'm with you there's nothing I wouldn't do
I just want to be your only one
I'm grasping out at straws thinking back to what I saw
That night on the floor when we were all alone

Who's gonna be the odd man out?
I don't want to be the odd man out
Is this going to be the end
Or are you going to be my new girlfriend?

There's this one guy
There's no one like him in all the world
'Cause you can always see
Those girls down on there knees

In those dark sweaty rooms
Planning out his thoughts
He's waiting for just the right

One by one as they
Walk right through the door, they
Keep on coming back I
Guess they just want more

He has fun fun fun and you
Might call him a whore, but
Just look where he's at 'cause
He is the one that scores

I saw my friend there
Out on the field today
I asked him where he's going, he said
"All the way," now

One by one as they
Walk right through the door, they
Keep on coming back I
Guess they just want more

He has fun fun fun and you
Might call him a whore, but
Just look where he's at 'cause
He is the one that scores

I know what it's like to be alone sitting in your room
Listening to all the doubts that your parents have to say to you

And as your head gets all cluttered inside
Try to stay awake
Everything they say are lies
That's all the shit that you ever have to take

So hold in all your aggresions
Because your grinding your teeth on down to
The bottom of your chin

It's not easy or so damn pleasing
To not laugh at everything they say that
They tell you what to be you're not alone

I know what it's like to be denied at everything you do
It's not the same reason why that
Makes you change the things that you once knew

As your head gets all cluttered inside
Give more than you take
Everything they say are lies
That's all the shit that you ever have to take

So hold in all your aggresions
Because your grinding your teeth on down to
The bottom of your chin

It's not easy or so damn pleasing
To not laugh at everything they say that
They tell you what to be you're not alone

You say you want to take off your shoes and
Walk barefoot down the street
Just to be the things that you can be
Just live for one more week (Go!)

You say you want to take off your shoes just to
Walk barefoot down the street
Just to be the things that you can be
Just live for one more week

So hold in all your aggresions
Because your grinding your teeth on down to
The bottom of your chin

It's not easy or so damn pleasing
To not laugh at everything they say that
They tell you what to be you're not alone

Who makes up all the rules about those girls I want?
Who tells them all to laugh?
Who tells them all to talk about me?

And I'm not sure what my purpose is for being here
Why do they, why do they
Always kick me in the groin when I come near

And I'm not complaining it just hurts after a bit.

I don't know what I'm feeling
I'm just so sick of seeing
All those dumb, lame, and retarded broads

Who often just sit kick back
As I am not so relaxed
I often wonder why they act so odd

Because no worse a time
When it's just your time to
Think you should make your move
It doesn't work as your just a jerk with no excuse

What about that situation
All night procrastination
Takes you to the point when you lead her to her door

There is nothing left there to say
I guess you best be on your way
But before you go you got to do that chore

No worse a time
When it's just your time to
Think you should make your move
It doesn't work as your just a jerk with no excuse

Please won't you buy in
I'm always tryin'
I keep on tryin'
There's only so much pride that I can lose

I hope that when you see me
You see right through me
Come on now, honestly
I'm so sick of endin' up without a clue

When you talk about tomorrow
I'm not sure about today
When you tell me that you love me
What am I supposed to say?

Sometimes I don't feel
The same way as you feel

Words like forever
They scare the shit out of me
Maybe I'm afraid of commitment
Maybe you're too distracted to see that

Sometimes I don't feel
The same way as you feel

I think of all the things I'd say to you if I had the chance again
I think of all the things I'd scream
But I think it's for the best
That you and I just don't connect and
Things are never quite what they seem

Will there ever be
Someone to give her heart to me
Or would I be to blind to see it

I wouldn't make a sound
I'd keep it underground

It always seems like I'm running around around
Running around around
Round

Sometimes I don't feel
The same way as you feel

I'm wasting time thinking about a girl
And stealing her away from her world
She and I would run away
I think of all the things that I'd say

We'd talk about important things
And I picture it in my dreams
She'd teach me about modern art
And I'd show her it's okay to fart and

Maybe I'd impress her
By being in a band and
Maybe if I act real tough
She'd let me hold her hand and
Maybe I'll win her heart
By writing this song about her

Sometimes I sit at home and
Wonder if she's sitting at home
Thinking of me and wondering if I'm
Sitting at home, thinking about her
Or am I just wasting my time

Remembering how she laughed at Kinko's
When I made fun of that guy
Remebering the look she gave me
When I told her that I used to fry

I really want to ask her out
But my ego could never take it
And even if I got the balls
You know that the Cougar would never make it

And in my town you can't drive naked

And maybe I'd impress her
By being in a band and
Maybe if I act real tough
She'd let me hold her hand and
Maybe I'll win her heart
By writing this song about her

Sometimes I sit at home and
Wonder if she's sitting at home
Thinking of me and wondering if I'm
Sitting at home, thinking about her
Or am I just wasting my time

Am I just wasting my time
Am I just wasting my time
Am I just wasting my time
Wasting my time thinking about a girl

Walking through the grass
Another blade next to you from the ground
As the wind does pass
I notice as you feel the breath of my shout

Your words are kind

I don't want to live alone
I don't want to live in
My broken dreams of you

I don't want to live along with
My broken dreams of you
I don't want to live along with
My broken dreams of you

(No we ain't gonna take it unless it's from a doverman pincher
Ladies and gentlemen, for your listening pleasure, Blink)

Passively one day as the sun rose out of it's house
So did this little old guy as he whistled out of his mouth
And happily and gay
Well I guessed exactly that
Because he found a special girl
That put him in a special trance

He fell in love so quickly
What the hell was he to expect
That the girl under his arm wasn't the same
As any other girl
That he had thought that he once met
I guess you could only blame fate

Things started getting weird as they started to kiss
She often felt his beard and remembered how her father she missed
And then quietly one day
He sang a song from deep within his heart
Causing some ingestion
He finished with a great big fart and

She knew at that one moment
That song was something she heard before
So she asked him to do that again

Then out the door they hurried
She was gonna find out for sure
So she analyzed his rear end

She said, "When I was a little girl my dad left my mom.
He used to always fart and sing this special song.
Now I wasn't quite so sure until your pants did fall.
'Cause now I know that your my dad because you use ben wah balls."

I said a wah, wah, wah-wah-wah,
Wah, wah-wah-wah, wah...
Ben wah ball wah, wah, wah-wah-wah,
Wah, wah-wah-wah, wah...

Just about done with your butt we'll let you know, hey [4x]
Just about done with your butt
Just about done with your butt we'll let you know
Just about done with your butt we'll let you know, hey [3x]
Just about done with your butt [2x]
Just about done with your butt we'll let you know,hey [2x]
Just about done, hey
Just about done with your butt
Just about done with your butt we'll let you know, hey

I don't want to urinate on myself
I don't want to urinate on anyone else
Well, I guess that really doesn't matter anymore
Because I can't control my bladder anymore

Well, I guess it all depends (undergarments)
Well, I guess it all depends (undergarments)

Step back in the light
No more soiled nights alone
But I guess I don't have a care
Because there's not a load in my underwear

I'm sick of offending everyone I meet (go, go, go, go)
I'm sick of crying myself to sleep on rubber sheets (go)
I had an accident today
I left a soil on a bus seat, I didn't know what to say

But, I guess it all depends (undergarments)
Well, I guess it all depends (undergarments)

Step back into life (go, go)
No more soiled nights alone
Well, I guess that I don't have a care
If I don't have a load in my underwear

I know I'm pathetic, I knew when she said it
A loser, a bum's what she called me when I drove her home
There's no more waiting and sure no more wasting
I've done all I can but she still wants to be left alone

You got, you got, you got to help me out
And I'll try not to argue
No one, no one, no one likes a drop-out
Mistakes are hard to undo

Don't pull me down, this is where I belong
I think I'm different, but I'm the same and I'm wrong
Don't pull me down, this is where I belong
I think I'm different, this is where I belong

I think it's disgusting, believing and trusting
If I gave a fuck there would be nothing for me to prove
Although it's amusing, it's slightly confusing
I've done all I can but her ego is still hard to move

You got, you got, you got to help me out
And I'll try not to argue
No one, no one, no one likes a drop-out
Mistakes are hard to undo

Don't pull me down, this is where I belong
I think I'm different, but I'm the same and I'm wrong
Don't pull me down, this is where I belong
I think I'm different, this is where I belong

Don't pull me down, this is where I belong
I think I'm different, this is where I belong

And when the day ends I'm sure she feels sorrow
The lonely guy I am, I wait for her to change
I've been here two days, I'll sure be here tomorrow
I'd eat her out if she were on my dinner plate

And I wish
I wish she'd be more kind now
I'm out of luck 'cause the shades are pulled down
I've seen everything there is to be shown
I followed her all the way home

I can't be too cool in a tree with my pants down
The air is cold and I've got splinters in my feet
She caught me once, but I don't think that she cares now
Unlike before, her view is now blocked by a leaf

And I wish
I wish she'd be more kind now
I'm out of luck 'cause the shades are pulled down
I've seen everything there is to be shown
I followed her all the way home

I bet this last time's the one time too many
The rush of waiting is burning through my head
Right after supper her brother showers twice a week
He kicks my ass so much, that filthy white inbred

I've made mistakes by looking in the wrong window
Her dad is big and I've never seen his face
I've been here two days, and I'll sure be here tomorrow
My lady's so sweet, she likes to entertain

And I wish
I wish she'd be more kind now
I'm out of luck 'cause the shades are pulled down
I've seen everything there is to be shown
I followed her all the way home

I bet this last time's the one time too many
The rush of waiting is burning through my head
Right after supper her brother showers twice a week
He kicks my ass so much, that filthy white inbred

It's alright
to tell me
what you think
about me
I won't try
to argue
or hold it
against you
I know that
you're leaving
you must have
your reasons
The season
is calling
and your pictures
are falling down

The steps that
I retrace
the sad look
on your face
The timing
and structure
did you hear
he fucked her?
A day late
a buck short
I'm writing
the report
On losing
and failing
when I move
I'm flailing now

And it's happened once again
I'll turn to a friend
Someone that understands
Sees through the master plan

But everybody's gone
And I've been here for too long
To face this on my own
Well I guess this is growing up

Well I guess this is growing up

And maybe
I'll see you
at a movie
sneak preview
You'll show up
and walk by
on the arm
of that guy
And I'll smile
and you'll wave
we'll pretend
it's okay
The charade
it won't last
when he's gone
I won't come back

And it'll happen once again
You'll turn to a friend
Someone that understands
And sees through the master plan

But everybody's gone
And you've been there for too long
To face this on your own
Well I guess this is growing up

Well, I guess this is growing up [4x]
Well, I guess this is growing up

You don't need nothin'
And I know that you won't even try
Don't wait for me to help you
Too late for any of my advice

No trust
All I got is lies
Boring
Alright

Misplaced your values
Forgot being the importance of being right
Don't sit there and act humble
I've heard your story a thousand times

No trust
All I got is lies
Boring
Alright

Please, mom
You ground me all the time
I know that I was right
All along

And I'm hoping
Remember I'm a kid
I know not what I did
Just having fun

You couldn't wait for something new
And yesterday I thought of you
It left me to think as if I couldn't walk away
It's too late, I fell through

Nothing to lose
A boy who went out when he finished all his chores
Nothing to do
They can't trust me because I blew it once before

Shit, dad
Please don't kick my ass
I know I've seen you trashed
At least one time

Can I blame it
On one of my dumb friends
It's been awhile
Since I have used that line

You couldn't wait for something new
And yesterday I thought of you
It left me to think as if I couldn't walk away
It's too late, I fell through

Nothing to lose
A boy who went out when he finished all his chores
Nothing to do
They can't trust me because I blew it once before

(Alright)

Nothing to lose
A boy who went out when he finished all his chores
Nothing to do
They can't trust me because I blew it once before

Watching your house shrink away in my rear-view mirror
As I drive away
Wishing that I could take back all those words
That meant nothing that I didn't say

I'm trying
To be what you want me to be
But it's so damn hard to keep playing the part
Of the fool, week after week

I think you need some time alone (I think you need some time alone)
You say you want someone to call your own
Open your eyes, you can suck in your pride
You can live your life all on your own

Is this all going to be just another time
That we play this game?
I've tried to convince you that things could be different
But somehow they end up the same

But what
Did you expect from me? What am I supposed to do?
You say that you're starting to feel like you're getting lost
Well, I do, too

I don't wanna live this lie again (I don't wanna live this lie again)
I know I'll get it right but I don't know when
I'll open my eyes, I've got something in side
I'll just jack off in my room until then

It's never over 'til it's done
And I don't think that you're the one
It's never over 'til it's done
And I don't think that you're the one

Am I strung out, crazy, or not allowed
To be the one who gets stupid over you
Lazy (lazy), laid back (laid back), maybe you're just on crack
Why am I the one who gets fucked up and confused?
(Go)

She doesn't care at all
She doesn't care at all
She doesn't care about those times we never shared at all

If I were the last of the few who always ask
Would you still be the same person that I knew
And if it's for me, another boring story
I swear I'll act enthused

I think of awhile ago
We might have had it all
But I was so stupid then
You needed time to grow

But now just as things change
As well my feelings do
In time things rearrange
I am so sick of chasing you

But what do I get 'cause I just seem to lose
You make me regret those times I spent with you
And playing those games as I wait for your call
And now I give up, so goodbye and so long

It's not a change of pace
This time I'll get it right
It's not a change of taste
I was the one there last night

You have your other friends
They were there when you cried
Didn't mean to hurt you then
Best friends just won't leave your side

But what do I get 'cause I just seem to lose
You make me regret those times I spent with you
And playing those games as I wait for your call
And now I give up, so goodbye and so long

It's not a change of pace
This time I'll get it right
It's not a change of taste
I was the one there last night

When I needed you most
When I needed a friend
You let me down now
Like I let you down then

So sorry, it's over
(Ahh...)

She didn't mean to deceive you, believe me
But sometimes the hardest part is conceiving

The good intentions that you had
Now only came to this
And although she saw the mark
The arrow missed

It isn't exciting reciting the stories
Of kind words turned hurting when routine get boring

Both getting tired of punk rock clubs
And both playing in punk rock bands
The start was something good
But some good things must end

And she said, "It could never survive
With such differing lives
One home, one out on tour again

We may never come back
The strike of a match
The candle's buring at both ends."

And now she knows too much
And I'm too fucked up
It's awkward trying to make my move

I'll pretend that I'm fine
Show up right on time
But I know I'll never be that cool

I never wanted to hold you back
I just wanted to hold on
But my chance is gone

I know
just where
I stand
a boy
Trapped in the body of a man and

I'll take what you're willing to give
And I'll teach myself to live
With a walk-on part of a background shot
From a movie I'm not in

She's so important
And I'm so retarded

And now I realize
I should have kissed you in L.A.
But I drove home all alone
As if I had a choice, anyway

Where are you coming from?
What are you running from?
Is it so hard to see?

And if you're feeling scared
Remember the time we shared
You know it meant everything (everything)
You know that it meant everything to me

You know that it meant everything to me

One more time you will laugh about it
And he'll never try to give you more
And I don't care, he is such a dick
Treats you like you are a stupid whore

And it seems like things will never change
You go on, every cloud is in your way
And I know you feel empty all the time
You'll never listen to anything that I say

She's better off sleeping on the floor
'Cause she fell right off when all
Is said, you know
It's okay to just want more

Why leave when you claim it is love?
But why stay when you're not the only one?
She's proved she's strong
Be brave, be strong

She's better off sleeping on the floor
'Cause she fell right off when all
Is said, you know
It's okay to just want more

She's better off sleeping on the floor
She's better off sleeping on the floor (Because she fell right off her bed)
She's better off sleeping on the floor
She's better off sleeping on the floor (Because she fell right off her bed)
She's better off sleeping on the floor
She's better off sleeping on the floor (Because she fell right off her bed)
She's better off sleeping on the floor
She's better off sleeping on the floor (Because she fell right off her bed)

Yeah, my girlfriend takes me home when I'm too drunk to drive
And she doesn't get all jealous when I hang out with the guys
She laughs at my dumb jokes when no one does
She brings me mexican food from Sombrero's just because
(Yeah, just because)

And my girlfriend likes U.L. and D.H.C.
And she's so smart and independent, I don't think she needs me
Quite half as much as I know I need her
I wonder why there's not another guy that she'd prefer

And when I feel like giving up
Like my world is falling down

I show up at 3am
She's still up watching Vacation, and I
See her pretty face
It takes me away to a better place and

(I know that everything [3x]) Everything's gonna be fine
(I know that everything [3x]) Everything's gonna be fine

Yeah, my girlfriend takes collect calls from the road
And it doesn't seem to matter that I'm lacking in the bulge
She laughs at my dumb jokes when no one does
She brings me mexican food from Sombrero's just because

And when I feel like giving up
Like my world is falling down

I show up at 3am
She's still up watching Vacation, and I
See her pretty face
It takes me away to a better place and

(I know that everything [3x]) Everything's gonna be fine
(I know that everything [3x]) Everything's gonna be fine
(I know that everything [3x]) Everything's gonna be fine
(I know that everything [3x]) Everything's gonna be fine

(I know that everything [3x]) Everything's gonna be fine
(I know that everything [3x]) Everything's gonna be fine
(I know that everything [3x]) Everything's gonna be fine
(I know that everything [3x]) Everything's gonna be fine

I've got her in my head
At night when I go to bed
And I know it sounds lame, but
She's the girl of my dreams

And of course I'd do anything for her
I'd search the moons of Endor
I'd even walk naked through
The deserts of Tatooine

Princess Leia, where are you tonight?
And who's laying there by your side?
Every night I fall asleep with you
And I wake up alone

And even though I'm not as cool as Han
I still want to be your man
You're exactly the kind of
Alderranian that I need

But when you were available, I was
Drinking Colt 45's with Lando
I was hanging out in the cantina
On Mos Eisley

Princess Leia, where are you tonight?
And who's laying there by your side?
Every night I fall asleep with you
And I wake up alone

Princess Leia [2x]

Princess Leia, where are you tonight?
And who's laying there by your side?
Every night I fall asleep with you
And I wake up alone

Crossed the street, naked at night
Bent over to show some moonlight
Pulled out some beer and I gulped it down
Nude in a gutter is how I was found

Thrown in the policecar and the door slammed
No noise, just silence, as I screamed, my dick was
Jammed, now in prison for one month, no one to see
All I got is a guy Ben Dover

Don't like hesh, don't like rap
Kicked ol' Sally 'cause she's fat
I'm a jerk, I'm a punk
Took a shower 'cause I stunk
Smoked a bong, killed a cat
Had my nuts attacked by rats
Dad got nude, I wore a thong
For a hobby I make bombs

Went to a farm to tip some cows
Forgot that I left my pants down
Bent over to pick them up
Felt a twelve gauge next to my hum-diddy-dum

The farmer took me to his house
Showed me the closet from the inside out
The police came, they took me away
Saw Ben Dover again and he's still gay

Don't like hesh, don't like rap
Kicked ol' Sally 'cause she's fat
I'm a jerk, I'm a punk
Took a shower 'cause I stunk
Smoked a bong, killed a cat
Had my nuts attacked by rats
Dad got nude, I wore a thong
For a hobby I make bombs

Don't like hesh, don't like rap
Kicked ol' Sally 'cause she's fat
I'm a jerk, I'm a punk
Took a shower 'cause I stunk
Smoked a bong, killed a cat
Had my nuts attacked by rats
Dad got nude, I wore a thong
For a hobby I make bombs

Don't bide your time
'Cause it is almost over
And I know you're down
And I'll see you around

And I know it hurts
But you're just getting older
And I know you'll win
You'll do it once again

Just yesterday
It always seemed like such a dream
We're unstoppable, indestructable
Nothing happens to our machine

And there's no harm
At least nothing I can see
As for you, not so true
You couldn't choose where his road would lead

What a loss
You just lost all your sleep
And we've always thought
That this could never happen, you see

That it's so hard
You gotta get up on your feet
'Cause the only way, I gotta say
Is to move on through the week

Don't bide your time
'Cause it is almost over
And I know you're down
And I'll see you around

And I know it hurts
But you're just getting older
And I know you'll win
You'll do it once again

Sorry [x16]
(Sorry...) Happened to you [x4]

Don't bide your time
'Cause it is almost over
And I know you're down
And I'll see you around

And I know it hurts
But you're just getting older
And I know you'll win
You'll do it once again

A freight train to the right, feeling that sting of pride
It's fucking with me, it's fucking with you
All's fair in love and war until you say it isn't but you're wrong

Words on the back of flyers, my clothes are in the dryer
It means nothing, nothing is changing
La familia is dead and gone, the children grew up and moved on

Is it too much to ask for the things to work out this time?
I'm only asking for what is mine
I wanted everything, I got it and now I'm gonna
Throw it away, I'll throw it away (yeah)

Prime select and a box of glazed, pulling fly-bys on days
When we were young and innocent
Elbow-drop Sundays when Mark Eaton got beat to shit

Laughing at the bands we hate, all the spots we used to skate
They're still there, but we've gone our own ways
I know it's for the best but sometimes I wonder
Will I ever have friends like you again?

Is it too much to ask for the things to work out this time?
I'm only asking for what is mine
I wanted everything, I got it and now I'm gonna
Throw it away, I'll throw it away (yeah)

Is it too much to ask for the things to work out this time?
I'm only asking for what is mine
I wanted everything, I got it and now I'm gonna
Throw it away, I'll throw it away (yeah)

You're gonna drown in the mess you make
Your self-inflicted hate
You turn your back on the friends you lose
When they don't follow all your rules

But people are what they wanna be
They're not lemmings to the sea
Maybe it's time you looked at yourself
And stop blaming life on someone else

It's understood, I said it many ways
Too scared to run, I'm too scared to stay
I said I'd leave, but I could never leave her
And if I did, you know I'd never cheat her
But this I ask, it's what I want to know
How would you feel, if I should choose to go
Another guy, you think it'd be unlikely
Another guy, you think he'd want to fight me

She's a dove, she's a fucking nightmare
Unpredictable, it was my mistake to stay here
On the go and it's way too late to play
I need a girl that I can train

I heard it once, I'm sure I heard it twice
My dad used to give me all of his advice
He would say you've got to turn your back and run now
Come on son, you haven't got a chance now

She's a dove, she's a fucking nightmare
Unpredictable, it was my mistake to stay here
On the go and it's way too late to play
I need a girl that I can train

She's a dove, she's a fucking nightmare
Unpredictable, it was my mistake to stay here
On the go and it's way too late to play
I need a girl that I can train

I need a girl that I can train
I need a girl that I can train

Turn your back and run now
You haven't got a chance now

I need a girl that I can train
I need a girl that I can train

Turn your back and run now
You haven't got a chance now

Don't leave me all alone
Just drop me off at home
I'll be fine, it's not the first
Just like last time but a little worse

And she said that I'm not the one that she thinks about
And she said it stopped being fun, I just bring her down
I said, "Don't let your future be destroyed by my past."
She said, "Don't let my door hit your ass."

One more chance I'll try this time
I'll give you yours, I won't take mine
I'll listen up, pretend to care
Go on ahead, I'll meet you there

And she said that I'm not the one that she thinks about
She said it stopped being fun, I just bring her down
I said, "Don't let your future be destroyed by my past."
She said, "Don't let my door hit your ass."

Let's try this one more time with feeling
One more time with feeling [3x]

She said that I'm not the one that she thinks about and
She said it stopped being fun, I just bring her down
I said, "Don't let your future be destroyed by my past."
She said, "Don't let my door hit your ass."

Don't leave me all alone
Just drop me off at home
And I'll be fine.

Hey mom there's something in the backroom
I hope it's not the creatures from above
You used to read me stories
As if my dreams were boring
We all know conspiracies are dumb

What if people knew that these were real
I'd leave my closet door open all night
I know the CIA would say
What you hear is all hearsay
I wish someone would tell me what was right

Up all night long
And there's something very wrong
And I know it must be late
Been gone since yesterday
I'm not like you guys
I'm not like you

I am still the skeptic yes you know me
Been best friends and will be till we die
I got an injection
Of fear from the abduction
My best friend thinks I'm just telling lies

Alright

Up all night long
And there's something very wrong
And I know it must be late
Been gone since yesterday
I'm not like you guys
I'm not like you

Dark and scary, ordinary,
Explanation, information,
Nice to know ya, paranoia
Where's my mother, biofather

Up all night long
And there's something very wrong
And I know it must be late
Been gone since yesterday
I'm not like you guys
Twelve majestic lies

Please take me by the hand
It's so cold out tonight
I'll put blankets on the bed
I won't turn out the light
Just don't forget to think about me
And I won't forget you
I'll write you once a week she said

Why does it feel the same
To fall in love or break it off
And if young love is just a game
Then I must have missed the kick off
Don't depend on me to ever follow through on anything
But I'd go through hell for you and

[Chorus:]
I haven't been this scared in a long time
And I'm so unprepared so here's your valentine
Bouquet of clumsy words, a simple melody
This world's an ugly place, but you're so beautiful to me

I'll think about the times
She kissed me after class
And she put up with my friends
I acted like an ass
I'd ditch my lecture to watch the girls play soccer
Is my picture still hanging in her locker?

I took her out. It was a Friday night
I wore cologne to get the feeling right
We started making out, and she took off my pants
But then I turned on the TV

And that's about the time she walked away from me
Nobody likes you when you're 23
And are still more amused by TV shows
What the hell is ADD?

My friends say I should act my age
What's my age again?
What's my age again?

Then later on, on the drive home
I called her mom from a pay phone
I said I was the cops, and your husband's in jail
This state looks down on sodomy

And that's about the time that bitch hung up on me
Nobody likes you when you're 23
And are still more amused by prank phone calls
What the hell is Call ID?

My friends say I should act my age
What's my age again?
What's my age again?

And that's about the time she walked away from me
Nobody likes you when you're 23
And you still act like you're in freshman year
What the hell is wrong with me?

My friends say I should act my age
What's my age again?
What's my age again?

That's about the time that she broke up with me
No one should take themselves so seriously
With many years ahead to fall in line
Why would you wish that on me?
I never wanna act my age
What's my age again?
What's my age again?

What's my age again?

Got a lotta heart ache
He's a fucking weasel
His issues make my mind ache
Want to make a deal

'Cause I love your little motions
You do with your pigtails
What a nice creation
Worth another night in jail

He's a player,
Diarrhea giver,
Tried to grow his hair
'Cause he's listening to Slayer

I would like to find him Friday night
Hanging out with mom and trying on his father's tights

Life just sucks,
I lost the one,
I'm giving up,
She found someone
There's plenty more,
Girls are such a drag

So all you little ladies
Be sure to choose the right guys
You'll come back to me maybe
I'll shower you with lies

Got a lotta heart ache
He's a fucking weasel
Decisions make my mind ache
Want to make a deal

Ease away the problems and the pain
The girl chose the guy who makes you want to kick and scream
All along, you wish that she would stay
Fuck the guy that took and ran away

He's a player,
Diarrhea giver,
Tried to grow his hair
'Cause he's listening to Slayer

I would like to find him Friday night
Hanging out with mom and trying on his father's tights

Life just sucks,
I lost the one,
I'm giving up,
She found someone
There's plenty more,
Girls are such a drag

Fuck this place,
I lost the war,
I hate you all,
Your mom's a whore
Where's my dog?
'Cause girls are such a drag

All the small things
True care, truth brings
I'll take one lift
Your ride best trip

Always I know
You'll be at my show
Watching, waiting, commiserating

Say it ain't so,
I will not go,
Turn the lights off,
Carry me home

Na, na...

Late night, come home
Work sucks, I know
She left me roses by the stairs,
Surprises, let me know she cares

Say it ain't so,
I will not go,
Turn the lights off,
Carry me home

Na, na...

Say it ain't so,
I will not go,
Turn the lights off,
Carry me home

Keep your head still,
I'll be your thrill,
The night will go on,
My little windmill

Say it ain't so,
I will not go,
Turn the lights off,
Carry me home

Keep your head still,
I'll be your thrill,
The night will go on,
The night will go on,
My little windmill

He pauses shaving and he tells himself that he is the bomb
She has her curlers set, her credit cards are paying the funds

He's not that old, I've been told a strong sexual goal
He goes out every day, she goes every way, oh, yeah
And they don't even care at all

She's open, waiting for more
And I know he's only looking to score
And it is way too unhealthy
Often they've typically
Been starved for attention before

She smokes a dozen, and he doesn't seem to notice the smell
He took the seat off his own bike because the way that it felt

He wants to bone, this I know, she is ready to blow
They go out every night, his pants are super tight, oh, yeah
And they don't even care at all

[2x]
She's open waiting for more
And I know he's only looking to score
And it is way too unhealthy
Often they've typically
Been starved for attention before

Let's take the boat out on the bay
Forget your job for just one day
I wish it didn't have to be so bad
It might be inappropriate because
Either way our band gets dropped, oh yeah
I wish it didn't have to be so bad

But I'd play with fire to break the ice
And I'd play with a nuclear device
Is it something I'll regret?
Why do I want what I can't get?
I wish it didn't have to be so bad

The three-date theory's getting old
Everyone's getting left out in the cold
I wish it didn't have to be so bad
So I'll see you with another guy
Who pretends not to hear you when you cry, oh yeah
I wish it didn't have to be so bad

But I'd play with fire to break the ice
And I'd play with a nuclear device
Is it something I'll regret?
Why do I want what I can't get?
I wish it didn't have to be so bad

I'll be moving on, moving on, moving on, and on, and on
Moving on, moving on, moving on, and on, and on

But I'd play with fire to break the ice
And I'd play with a nuclear device
Is it something I'll regret?
Why do I want what I can't get?
I wish it didn't have to be so bad
I wish it didn't have to be so bad
I wish it didn't have to be so bad
I wish it didn't have to be so bad

Home show, mom won't know
Run out the back door
He's passed out on the floor
Third time, been caught twice
Forgive our neighbor Bob
I think he humped the dog

But good things come to those who wait
'Cause she laid me
And mom and dad posses the key - instant slavery
No need explain the plan, no need to even bother
I'll pack my bags, I swear I'll run - wish my friends were 21

White lies, bloodshot eyes
Breath of alcohol, stole it from the mall
How's Chris marked with lipstick
Better call their fathers, sleeping with your daughters

But good things come to those who wait
'Cause she laid me
And mom and dad posses the key - instant slavery
No need explain the plan, no need to even bother
I'll pack my bags, I swear I'll run - wish my friends were 21

You don't belong, you left the kids to carry on
You planned their fall
To bad you're wrong
Don't need a mom dad slave drive song

I time bomb, I time bomb, I time bomb
I time bomb, I time bomb

Turn low the radio, I think I hear my dad
Yelling at the band

But good things come to those who wait
'Cause she laid me
And mom and dad posses the key - instant slavery
No need explain the plan, no need to even bother
I'll pack my bags, I swear I'll run - wish my friends were 21

You don't belong, you left the kids to carry on
You planned their fall
To bad you're wrong
Don't need a mom dad slave drive song

I time bomb, I time bomb, I time bomb
I time bomb, I time bomb, I time bomb
I time bomb, I time bomb, I time bomb

Everything has fallen to pieces
Earth is dying help me Jesus
We need guidance, we've been misled
Young and hostile, but not stupid

Corporate leaders, politicians
Kids can't vote, adults elect them
Laws that rule the school and workplace
Signs that caution, sixteen's unsafe

We really need to see this through
We never wanted to be abused
We'll never give up, it's no use
If we're fucked up you're to blame

Let this train wreck burn more slowly
Kids are victims in this story
Drown our youth with useless warnings
teenage rules they're fucked and boring

We really need to see this through
We never wanted to be abused
We'll never give up, it's no use
If we're fucked up you're to blame

Everything has fallen to pieces
Everything has fallen to pieces
Everything has fallen to pieces
Everything has fallen to pieces
Everything has fallen to ...

We really need to see this through
we never wanted to be abused
We'll never give up, it's no use
if we're fucked up you're to blame!

Josie
You're my source of most frustration
Forget when
I don't meet expectations
Everything you wished came true
In the end we all blamed you
Even though, as they all know, you weren't the only one (two three four)

Why do you still keep it around
When you know it brings me down
I'm hating everything
And I know that you dated other guys
But I got to wonder why
You'd leave it out for me

Why am I still hanging around
When I know it brings me down
I'm hating everything
And you are getting rides home in his car
You're making out in his front yard
I'm hating everything

Please don't remind me
Put your past behind me
It shines so bright it blinds me
I wish that this would end
And I am not fine
Last night I saw you online
Your screen name used to be mine
Why can't we just pretend?

And if we can have another day
I've got so much left to say
I'd tell you everything
And I'll laugh when I think about the past
When I see you after class you're hating everything

Please don't remind me
Put your past behind me
It shines so bright it blinds me
I wish that this would end
And I am not fine
Last night I saw you online
Your screen name used to be mine
Why can't we just pretend
[x2]

And she said
Na (x13)
"I just forgot you were there"
Na (x13)
"I just forgot you were there"
Na (x13)
"I just forgot you were there"
Na (x15)

Please don't remind me
Put your past behind me
It shines so bright it blinds me
I wish that this would end
And I am not fine
Last night I saw you online
Your screen name used to be mine
Why can't we just pretend
[x2]

And she said
Na na na na na

In the car I just can't wait,
to pick you up on our very first date
Is it cool if I hold your hand?
Is it wrong if I think it's lame to dance?
Do you like my stupid hair?
Would you guess that I didn't know what to wear?
I'm too scared of what you think
You make me nervous so I really can't eat

Let's go, don't wait, this night's almost over
Honest, let's make this night last forever
Forever and ever, let's make this last forever
Forever and ever, let's make this last forever

When you smile, I melt inside
I'm not worthy for a minute of your time
I really wish it was only me and you
I'm jealous of everybody in the room
Please don't look at me with those eyes
Please don't hint that you're capable of lies
I dread the thought of our very first kiss
A target that i'm probably gonna miss

Let's go, don't wait, this night's almost over
Honest, let's make this night last forever
Forever and ever, let's make this last forever
Forever and ever, let's make this last forever

Let's go, don't wait, this night's almost over
Honest, let's make, this night last forever
Forever and ever, let's make this last forever
Forever and ever, let's make this last forever
Forever and ever, let's make this last forever
Forever and ever, let's make this last forever

It's Christmas Eve and I've only wrapped two fuckin' presents
It's Christmas Eve and I've only wrapped two fuckin' presents
And I hate, hate, hate your guts
I hate, hate, hate your guts
And I'll never talk to you again
Unless your dad will suck me off
I'll never talk to you again
Unless your mom will touch my cock
I'll never talk to you again
Ejaculate into a sock
I'll never talk to you again
I'll never talk to you again

It's Labor day and my grandpa just ate seven fuckin' hotdogs
It's Labor day and my grandpa just ate seven fuckin' hotdogs
And he shit shit shits his pants
He's always fuckin' shittin' his pants
And I'll never talk to you again
Unless your dad will suck me off
I'll never talk to you again
Unless your mom will touch my cock
I'll never talk to you again
Ejaculate into a sock
I'll never talk to you again
I'll never talk to you again

Push it out, fake a smile
Avert disaster, just in time
I need a drink, cause in a while
Worthless answers from friends of mine
It's dumb to ask, cool to ignore
Girls possess me, but they're never mine
I made my entrance, avoided hazards
Checked my engine, I fell behind

I fell behind

She makes me feel like it's raining outside
And when the storm's gone I'm all torn up inside
I'm always nervous on, days like this like the prom
I get too scared to move, cause I'm a fuckin' boy

Remember when I was in the grocery store, now's my time
Lost the words, lost the nerve, lost the girl, left the line
I would wish upon a star, but that star, it doesn't shine
So read my book with a boring ending
A short story of a lonely guy

Who fell behind

She makes me feel like it's raining outside
And when the storm's gone I'm all torn up inside
I'm always nervous on, days like this like the prom
I get too scared to move, cause I'm a fuckin' boy

She makes me feel like it's raining outside
And when the storm's gone I'm all torn up inside
I'm always nervous on, days like this like the prom
I get too scared to move, cause I'm still just a stupid worthless boy

Hanging out behind the club on the weekend
Acting stupid, getting drunk with my best friends
I couldn't wait for the summer and the Warped Tour
I remember it's the first time that I saw her there

She's getting kicked out of school 'cause she's failing
I'm kinda nervous, 'cause I think all her friends hate me
She's the one, she'll always be there
She took my hand and I made it I swear

Because I fell in love with the girl at the rock show
She said, "What?" and I told her that I didn't know
She's so cool, gonna sneak in through her window
Everything's better when she's around
I can't wait 'til her parents go out of town
I fell in love with the girl at the rock show

When we said we were gonna move to Vegas
I remember the look her mother gave us
Seventeen without a purpose or direction
We don't owe anyone a fucking explanation

I fell in love with the girl at the rock show
She said, "What?" and I told her that I didn't know
She's so cool, gonna sneak in through her window
Everything's better when she's around
I can't wait 'til her parents go out of town
I fell in love with the girl at the rock show

Black and white picture of her on my wall
I waited for her call, she always kept me waiting
And if I ever got another chance I'd still ask her to dance
Because she kept me waiting

I fell in love with the girl at the rock show
She said, "What?" and I told her that I didn't know
She's so cool, gonna sneak in through her window
Everything's better when she's around
I can't wait 'til her parents go out of town
I fell in love with the girl at the rock show

With the girl at the rock show
With the girl at the rock show
(I'll never forget tonight)
With the girl at the rock show

It's hard to wake up, when the shades have been pulled shut
This house is haunted, it's so pathetic, it makes no sense at all
I'm ripe with things to say, the words rot and fall away
If this stupid poem could fix this home, I'd read it every day

So here's your holiday
Hope you enjoy it this time, you gave it all away
It was mine, so when you're dead and gone
Will you remember this night, twenty years now lost
It's not right

Their anger hurts my ears, been running strong for seven years
Rather than fix the problems, they never solve them, it makes no sense at all
I see them everyday, we get along so why can't they?
If this is what he wants, and it's what she wants, then why is there so much pain?

So here's your holiday
Hope you enjoy it this time, you gave it all away
It was mine, so when you're dead and gone
Will you remember this night, twenty years now lost
It's not right

So here's your holiday
Hope you enjoy it this time, you gave it all away
It was mine, so when you're dead and gone
Will you remember this night, twenty years now lost?
It's not right
It's not right
It's not right
It's not right

Breathing deeply, walking backwards
Finding strength to call and ask her
Roller Coaster favorite ride
Let me kiss you one last time

Leave me standing here, act like I'm not around
The coast will probably never clear, can I please go home now
I had that dream about you again
Where I wait outside until you let me in
And there I stay

Lay beside me and listen at the wall
We'll keep on lying until the summer comes
I had that dream about you again
Where you drive my car right off the fucking cliff

And now I'm breathing deeply, walking backwards
Finding strength to call and ask her
Roller Coaster favorite ride
Let me kiss you one last time

Make me promise that I will never tell
All I remember is the way her bedroom smelled
I had that dream about you again
Where I wait outside until you let me in

And now I'm breathing deeply, walking backwards
Finding strength to call and ask her
Roller Coaster favorite ride
Let me kiss you one last time good night

Good night

On and on, reckless abandon
Something's wrong, this is gonna shock them
Nothing to hold on to
We'll use this song to lead you on

I learned a lot today
Not sure if I'll get laid
Not sure if I'll fail or pass
Kissed every girl in class

Everybody would waste it all
To have a summer that they could call
A memory that's full of fun
Fucked up, when it's all done

On and on, reckless abandon
Something's wrong, this is gonna shock them
Nothing to hold on to
We'll use this song to lead you on
And break the truth with more bad news
We left a scar, size extra large

Sip a drink of the alcohol
End up kneeling in bathroom stalls
Eyes are red and my movements slow
Too high, got vertigo
He took a shit in the bathroom tub
And fed the dog the brownie drug
Tried hard to not get caught
He fucked a chick in a parking lot

On and on, reckless abandon
Something's wrong, this is gonna shock them
Nothing to hold on to
We'll use this song to lead you on
And break the truth with more bad news
We left a scar, size extra large

Break a window and bust a wall
Making fun of your friends mom
Turn the music up way too loud
Charge the pizza to the house
Everybody would waste it all
To have a summer that they could call
Memory that's full of fun
Fucked up when it's all done

On and on, reckless abandon
Something's wrong, this is gonna shock them
Nothing to hold on to
We'll use this song to lead you on
And break the truth with more bad news
We left a scar, size extra large

I never found out why you left him
But this answer begs that question
Too blind to see tomorrow
Too broke to beg or borrow
Young and stupid, left wide open
Hearts are wasted, lives are broken

One more point of contention
I need some intervention
Approached with vague intentions
Betray my short attention
Span the distance, bridge the border
Beg forgiveness, round the corner

Everytime I look for you the sun goes down
And I stumble when this whole thing runs aground
I left another message, you are never around
But everytime I look for you the sun goes down once more
Will the last one out, please shut the door

More time apart will give you
A few more months to argue
Is this to much to live through?
It always seems too far to drive
The point home, send more letters
Pray tomorrow, ends up better

Everytime I look for you, the sun goes down
And I stumble when the whole thing runs aground
I left another message, you are never around
But everytime I look for you the sun goes down once more
Will the last one out, please shut the door

I never did do anything that she asked
I never let what happened, stay in the past
I never did quite understand what she meant
In spite of everything, in spite of everything

Everytime I look for you the sun goes down
And I stumble when this whole thing runs aground
I left another message, you are never around
But everytime I look for you the sun goes down
And I stumble when this whole thing runs aground
I left another message, you are never around
But everytime I look for you the sun goes down

Mom and dad they quite don't understand it
All the kids they laugh as if they planned it
Why do girls wanna pierce their nose
And walk around in torn pantyhose, oh yeah

I like the ones who say they listen to the punk rock
I like the the kids who fight against how they were brought up
They hate the trends and think it's fucked to care
It's cool when they piss people off with what they wear, oh yeah

So give me one good reason
Why we need to be like them
Kids will have fun and offend
They don't want to and don't fit in

Hate the jocks, the preps, the hippie fuckin scumbags
Heavy metalers with their awful pussy hair bands
Counting seconds until we can get away
Ditching school almost every single day, oh yeah

So give me one good reason
Why we need to be like them
Kids will have fun and offend
They don't want to and don't fit in

So give me one good reason
Why we need to be like them
Kids will have fun and offend
They don't want to and don't fit in

Shut the fuck up she said, I'm going fucking deaf
You're always too loud, everything's too loud
Now that all my friends left, this place is fucking dead
I wanna move out, when can we move out? This shit has got to stop

I'll run away

Get the fuck up, she said your life is meaningless
it's going nowhere, you're going nowhere
you're just a fuck-up, she said I'll live alone instead
she said you don't care, I know I don't care

I'll never ask permission from you,
fuck off I'm not listening to you
I'm not coming home, I'm never going to come back home

I got too fucked up again, and passed out on the plane
Tried to forget you, i can't forget you
No sleep on this flight, I'll think about the nights
we had to get through, how did we get through?

I'll never ask permission from you,
fuck off I'm not listening to you
I'm not coming home, I'm never going to come back home

I'll run away
I think it's time that I should leave
I think it's time that I should leave
I think it's time that I should leave
I think it's time that I should leave

I'll never ask permission from you,
fuck off i'm not listening to you
I'm not coming home, I'm never going to come back home

I'll run away
I think it's time for me to leave
I think it's time for me to leave
I think it's time for me to leave
I think it's time for me to leave

Oh no it happened again
She's cool, she's hot, she's my friend
I'd drive for hours, it's so
You leave me nowhere to go

She's unstoppable, unpredictable
I'm so jaded, calculated, wrong

Please take me home, too late, it's gone
I bet you're sad, this is the best time we ever had

I hope, hope that it lasts
Give in, forget the past
Be strong when things fall apart
Honest this breaks my heart

She's unstoppable, unpredictable
I'm so jaded, calculated, wrong

Please take me home, too late, it's gone
I bet you're sad, this is the best time we ever had
Please take me home, too late, it's gone
I bet you're sad, this is the best time we ever had

Why did we have to go date?
It's too easy to complicate
Be strong when things fall apart
Be strong when things fall apart
Honest this breaks my heart
It's so hard

Let's go!

Please take me home, too late, it's gone
I bet you're sad, this is the best time we ever had
Please take me home, too late, it's gone
I bet you're sad, this is the best time we ever had

I'm sick of always hearing
All the sad songs on the radio
All day it is there to remind an over sensitive guy
That he's lost and alone, yeah

I hate our favorite restaurant, favorite movie, our favorite show
We would stay up all through the night
We would laugh and get high
And never answer the phone

I can't forgive
Can't forget
Can't give in what went wrong
Cause you said this was right
You fucked up my life

I'm sick of always hearing
Sappy love songs on the radio
This place is fucking cursed in it's plague
And I can never escape when my heart it explodes

I can't forgive
Can't forget
Can't give in what went wrong
Cause you said this was right
You fucked up my life

I'm kicking out fiercely at the world around me
What went wrong [x4]

I'm kicking

[tom]
I want to fuck a dog in the ass

[mark]
he wants to fuck a dog in the ass

[tom]
I wanna fuck a dog
That's right kids.

I tried to fuck your mom in the ass
Tried to fuck your dad in the ass

Aarrh me and me first mate asurvy cur

Tried to fuck a fucking pirate

[music continues]

[mark and tom]
We want to fuck a dog in the ass
We want to fuck a dog in the ass
wanna fuck a fucking dog

[mark]
fuck you

I guess its only the men
Who get fucked now and again
We take our chicks to the mall,
We wait in parking stalls
And when we come home too late,
She's pissed that she had to wait
And my excuse not to call,
It never worked at all

Time to wake up
Where's your daughter?
Hurt's to break up,
She was stronger
All my friends say,
Please don't love her
What did i gain?
Now i miss her so

I used to hate the lipstick
It stained and tasted so sick
The pantyhose and the bras,
She threw on my guitars
Shit fuck i made a mistake,
I thought i needed a break
The truth is i'm such a dick,
It's broke and can't be fixed

Time to wake up
Where's your daughter?
Hurt's to break up,
She was stronger
All my friends say,
Please don't love her
What did i gain?
Now i miss her so

If you wanna call it a heartache,
Then i shouldn't regret those things, i miss her
If you want the pain to go away,
Better suck up your pride and admit you lost her
Let her go, move on, let her go, move on, let her go

Time to wake up
Where's your daughter?
Hurt's to break up,
She was stronger
All my friends say,
Please don't love her
What did i gain?
Now i miss her so

Move on, let her go, move on, let her go,
move on, let her go, move on, let her go

It's mother's day
It's mother's day
It's mother's day
It's mother's day

I hear the phone, it rings so violently
Can't leave my room, can't breathe since she left me
I will admit I hate those things I said
Girls will always cry, guys will never admit they did

Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on

Don't tell me that it's over
I'm not used to this temptation
And when you come back running
There's no use for explanation
I think things are too hopeful
Even with my expert knowledge
Most girls do mean trouble
Because they are rarely honest

What's with the jokes, all the routines they play
Screw with my head, never cave until they get their way
Guys like to run, chicks love to yell, you see
Guys hate to fight, girls think it's therapy

Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on

Don't tell me that it's over
I'm not used to this temptation
And when you come back running
There's no use for explanation
I think things are too hopeful
Even with my expert knowledge
Most girls do mean trouble
Because they are rarely honest

Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on

Don't tell me that it's over

There's no use for explanation
I think things are too hopeful

Unos, dos, tres, cuatro...

When you fucked Grandpa did he tell you that he loved you?
Did he hold you till the sun did rise and did he look into your eyes
And ask you to fellate him, and stick a finger or two in his ass

He seems like a total asshole, Grandpa is a total fucking asshole
Who would ever want a dirty, greasy finger in his ass?
He rubs his dick in broken glass.

When you fucked Grandpa did he kiss you soft and tender?
Did he tie your hands behind your head and was it on your mother's bed and...

(He seems like a total asshole, Grandpa is a total fucking asshole
Who would ever want a dirty, greasy finger in his ass?
He rubs his dick in broken glass.)

This is fucking stupid, man!
I can't believe you'd have sex with your own grandfather.
I mean, you guys are related! What's he gonna do?
Take out his false teeth and just leave them on the side of your bed?
Man, you like to fuck him in the butt and then have people come in and watch and masturbate and cum all over the place.
This is stupid. I hate you all.
I'm not even gonna have sex with my mom tonight, man, this is stupid!
I hate you.

{Get ready for action!}
I got no regret right now (I'm feeling this)
The air is so cold and low (I'm feeling this)
Let me go in her room (I'm feeling this)
I wanna take off her clothes (I'm feeling this)
Show me the way to bed (I'm feeling this)
Show me the way you move (I'm feeling this)
Fuck it, it's such a blur (I'm feeling this)
I love all the things you do (I'm feeling this)

Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna

Where do we go from here
Turn all the lights down now
Smiling from ear to ear (I'm feeling this)
Our breathing has got too loud (I'm feeling this)
Show me the bedroom floor (I'm feeling this)
Show me the bathroom mirror (I'm feeling this)
We're taking this way too slow (I'm feeling this)
Take me away from here (I'm feeling this)

Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna

Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna

This place was never the same again
After you came and went
How can you say you meant anything different
To anyone standing alone
On the street with a cigarette
On the first night we met

Look to the past
And remember and smile
And maybe tonight
I can breathe for awhile
I'm not in the scene
I think I'm fallin' asleep
But then all that it means is
I'll always be dreaming of you

Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna

Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna

Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer (So lost and disillusioned)
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna (So lost and disillusioned)

Fate fell short this time (Are we alone? Do you feel it?)
Your smile fades in the summer (So lost and disillusioned)
Place your hand in mine (Are we alone? Do you feel it?)
I'll leave when I wanna (So lost and disillusioned)

Fate fell short this time (Are we alone? Do you feel it?)
Your smile fades in the summer (So lost and disillusioned)
Place your hand in mine (Are we alone? Do you feel it?)
I'll leave when I wanna (So lost and disillusioned)

I saw you again
I think you used me again
Should we try this before we give up and move on
And pretend to restore what we have and hold on
At times like these
It's obvious
I saw you again
I know you fucked him again
Can you comfort yourself with a sense of revenge
Are you leaving me here with the taste of the end

At times like these
It's obvious
At times like these
It's obvious

I saw you again and again and again
There's some room to move on, to move on, to move on
And I saw you again and again and again
How do we fix this if we never have vision

I saw you again and again and again
There's some room to move on, to move on, to move on
And I saw you again and again and again
How do we fix this if we never have vision

I saw you again and again and again
There's some room to move on, to move on, to move on
And I saw you again and again and again
How do we fix this if we never have vision

I saw you again and again and again
There's some room to move on, to move on, to move on
And I saw you again and again and again
How do we fix this if we never have vision

Hello there,
The angel from my nightmare,
The shadow in the background of the morgue.
The unsuspecting victim of darkness in the valley.
We can live like Jack and Sally
If we want.

Where you can always find me
And we'll have Halloween on Christmas.
And in the night we'll wish this never ends,
We'll wish this never ends.

(I miss you, miss you)
(I miss you, miss you)

Where are you?
And I'm so sorry.
I cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight.
I need somebody and always
This sick strange darkness
Comes creeping on so haunting every time.

And as I stared I counted
The webs from all the spiders
Catching things and eating their insides.

Like indecision to call you
And hear your voice of treason.
Will you come home and stop this pain tonight?
Stop this pain tonight.

[3x]
Don't waste your time on me.
You're already the voice inside my head.
(I miss you, miss you)
Don't waste your time on me.
You're already the voice inside my head.
(I miss you, miss you)

(I miss you, miss you) [4x]

Six bottles went down the drain
One hour's a waste of time
I'd ask if you feel the same
Still pushing that chance to try
Your breath in this cool room chill
Long hair that blows side to side
You speak and make time stand still
And each time you walk right on by

Like violence you have me, forever, and after
Like violence you kill me, forever and after

Can't count all the eyes that stare
Can't count all the things they see
She kills with no life to spare
Just victims are left to bleed
One drink and the pain goes down
Soft shadows lay by her feet
Lay soft as you slowly drown
Lay still while you fall asleep. (Fall asleep)

Like violence you have me, forever, and after
Like violence you kill me, forever and after
(And after…and after…and after)

Like violence you have me, forever, and after
Like violence you kill me…
Like violence you have me, forever, and after
Like violence you kill me…

Like violence you have me, forever, and after
Like violence you kill me, forever and after
Like violence you have me, forever, and after
Like violence you kill me, forever and after

[Lady's voice:]
My dearest
I've missed you very very much since that last night we were together
And will hold that night especially in my memories for years to come
I've been turning it over and over in my mind lately
I've read your letter through at least 4 times
And will probably read it more times before I'm through
I've been sitting here
Looking at your picture and getting more homesick every minute
I've wanted that picture more than anything else I know of
Except of course you, yourself
I keep thinking of you darling
I keep wishing I could be home with you
I want to leave in the worst possible way
So I could come home to see you
But things don't look too good on that subject
This war has spoiled a lot of things for everyone I guess
I've never been so lonesome in my life as I am right now
I'm completely lost without you darling
I never realized I could miss any one person so much
I just hope it won't be too much longer 'til I'm able to be with you again
And live a sane and normal life

This is the first (thing I remember)
Now it's the last (thing left on my mind)
Afraid of the dark (do you hear me whisper)
An empty heart (replaced with paranoia)
Where do we go (life's temporary)
After we're gone (like new years resolutions)
Why is this hard (do you recognize me)
I know I'm wrong (but I can't help believing)

I'm so lost
I'm barely here
I wish I could explain myself
But words escape me
It's too late
To save me
You're too late
You're too late

You're cold with disappointment
While I'm drowning in the next room
The last contagious victim of this plague between us
I'm sick with apprehension
I'm crippled from exhaustion
And I dread the moment when you finally come to kill me

This is the first (thing I remember)
Now it's the last (thing left on my mind)
Afraid of the dark (do you hear me whisper)
An empty heart (replaced with paranoia)
Where do we go (life's temporary)
After we're gone (like new years resolutions)
Why is this hard (do you recognize me)
I know I'm wrong (but I can't help believing)

The drops of rain they fall all over
This awkward silence makes me crazy
The glow inside burns light upon her
I'll try to kiss you if you let me
(this can't be the end)

Tidal waves they rip right through me
Tears from eyes worn cold and sad
Pick me up now, I need you so bad

Down down down down [x4]
It gets me so
Down down down down [x4]
It gets me so

Your vows of silence fall all over
The look in your eyes makes me crazy
I feel the darkness break upon her
I'll take you over if you let me
(You did this)

Tidal waves they rip right through me
Tears from eyes worn cold and sad
Pick me up now, I need you so bad.

Down down down down [x4]
It gets me so
Down down down down [x4]
It gets me so

Down, down, down,
Pick me up I'm falling

Are we all victims of opportunity
Locked outside the door back in '83
I heard the angry voice of the man inside
And saw the look of fear in my mother's eyes
GO GO GO GO GO GO GO GO
I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know

Mom get in the car and let's drive away
She said I'm sorry Mark but there's nowhere to stay
Gave up all her hope and went back inside
Hid her broken heart and let the engine die

GO GO GO GO GO GO GO GO
I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know

Why do evil men get away with it
Can't you see that I'm in a world of shit
Turn your back on hope and go back inside
Stop my bleeding heart and let the engine die

I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know

I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know

Last night it came as a picture
With a good reason, a warning sign
This place is void of all passion
If you can imagine it's easy if you try
Believe me I failed this effort
I wrote a reminder this wasn't a vision
This time where are you Houston
Is somebody out there will somebody listen

Should I go back should I go back should I
I feel alone and tired
Should I go back should I go back should I
I hope I won't forget you

My head is made up of memories
Most of them useless delusions
This room is bored of rehearsal
And sick of the boundaries
I miss you so much

Should I go back should I go back should I
I feel alone and tired
Should I go back should I go back should I
This time I don't want to
Should I go back should I go back should I
I feel alone and tired
Should I go back should I go back should I
I hope I won't forget you

Should I go back should I go back should I
I feel alone and tired
Should I go back should I go back should I
This time I don't want to
Should I go back should I go back should I
I feel alone and tired
Should I go back should I go back should I
I hope I won't forget you

I've been here before a few times
And I'm quite aware we're dying
And your hands they shake with goodbyes
And I'll take you back if you'd have me
So here I am I'm trying
So here I am are you ready

Come on let me hold you, touch you, feel you
Always
Kiss you, taste you all night
Always

And I'll miss your laugh your smile
I'll admit I'm wrong if you'd tell me
I'm so sick of fights, I hate them
Lets start this again for real

So here I am I'm trying
So here I am are you ready
So here I am I'm trying
So here I am are you ready

Come on let me hold you, touch you, feel you
Always
Kiss you taste you all night
Always
(Come on let me hold you) Touch you, feel you
Always
Kiss you, taste you all night
Always

I've been here before a few times
And I'm quite aware we're dying

Come on let me hold you, touch you, feel you
Always
Kiss you, taste you all night
Always
(Come on let me hold you) Touch you, feel you
Always
Kiss you, taste you all night
Always

Always..

Always..

All her signals are getting lost in the ether (That’s what she wanted)
She's a landslide with a city beneath her (That’s what she wanted)
So take a good look, so you'll never forget it (That's what she wanted)
Take a deep breath, I know I'm gonna regret it (That's what she wanted)

Holli's looking dry looking for an easy target
Let her slit my throat give her ammo if she'll use it
Caution on the road lies lies and hidden danger.
Southern California's breeding mommy's little monster.

She's got a mission, and I'm collateral damage. (That's what she wanted)
She's the flower that you place on my casket. (That's what she wanted)
Savor the moment cause the memory's fleeting.
Take a photograph, as the last train is leaving.

Holli's looking dry looking for an easy target
Let her slit my throat give her ammo if she'll use it
Caution on the road lies lies and hidden danger.
Southern California's breeding mommy's little monster.

Better run run run run run (Holly let me out)
Better run run run run run (Holly let me out)
Better run run run run run (Holly let me out)
Better run run run run run run run (Holly let me out)

With all of this I know now
Everything inside of my head
It all just goes to show how
Nothing I know changes me at all
Again I wait for this to change instead
To tear the world in two
Another night with her
But I'm always wanting you

Use me Holly come on and use me
We know where we go
Use me Holly come on and use me
We go where we know

With all of this I feel now
Everything inside of my heart
It all just seems to be how
Nothing I feel pulls at me at all
Again I wait for this to pull apart
To break my time in two
Another night with her
But I'm always wanting you

Use me Holly come on and use me
We know where we go
Use me Holly come on and use me
We go where we know

She's all I need
She's all I dream
She's all I'm always wanting
She's all I need
She's all I dream
She's all I'm always wanting you

Oh again I wait for this to fill the holes
To shake the sky in two
Another night with her
I'm always wanting you
Another night with her
But I'm always wanting you

Cut the skin to the bone
Fall asleep all alone
Hear your voice in the dark
Lose myself in your eyes
Choke my voice Say goodnight
as the world falls apart
Fuck I can't let this kill me, let go
I need some more time to fix this

Here's a letter for you
But the words get confused
And the conversation dies
Apologize for the past
Talk some shit take it back
Are we cursed to this life

Fuck I can't let this kill me, let go
I need some more time to fix this problem
I need some more time to fix this problem
I need some more time to fix this

I'm talking to the ceiling
My life just lost all meaning
Do one thing for me tonight
I'm dying in this silence

The last star left in heaven
Is falling down to earth and
Do you still feel the same way
Do you still feel the same way

Fuck I can't let this kill me, let go
I need some more time to fix this problem
I need some more time to fix this problem
I need some more time to fix this

I swear that I can go on forever again
Please let me know that my one bad day will end
I will go down as your lover, your friend
Give me your lips and with one kiss we begin
Are you afraid of being alone
Cause I am, I'm lost without you
Are you afraid of leaving tonight
Cause I am, I'm lost without you

I'll leave my room open till sunrise for you
I'll keep my eyes patiently focused on you
Where are you now I can hear footsteps I'm dreaming
And if you will, keep me from waking to believe this

Are you afraid of being alone
Cause I am, I'm lost without you
Are you afraid of leaving tonight
Cause I am, I'm lost without you

Are you afraid of being alone
Cause I am, I'm lost without you
Are you afraid of leaving tonight
Cause I am, I'm lost without you
Are you afraid of being alone
Cause I am, I'm lost without you
Are you afraid of leaving tonight
Cause I am, I'm lost without you

I'm lost without you
I'm lost without you

Come here, please hold my hand, Lord, now
Help me, I'm scared please show me how to fight this
God has a master plan
And I guess
I am in his demand
Please save me this time I cannot run
And I'll see you when this is done
And now I have come to realize
That you are the one who's left behind

Please stay until I'm gone
I'm here hold on to me I'm right here
Waiting

I see, a light it feels good
And I'll come back soon just like you would
It's useless, my name has made the list
And I wish, I gave you one last kiss

Please stay until I'm gone
I'm here hold on to me I'm right here
Waiting and take
My one last breath, and don't forget
That I will be right here
Waiting

Please stay until I'm gone
I'm here hold on to me I'm right here
Waiting and take
My one last breath, and don't forget
That I will be right here
Waiting

Please stay until I'm gone
I'm here hold on to me I'm right here
Waiting and take
My one last breath, and don't forget
That I will be right here
Waiting

Please stay until I'm gone
I'm here hold on to me I'm right here
Waiting and take
My one last breath, and don't forget
That I will be right here
Waiting

I'll never let you down boy
I'll never let you go
Her subtle hint of life
Is so innocent and scary
"So tell me that you're here boy"
She says as if she knows
When God took her with time
God made me quite alone

It's like the universe has left me
Without a place to go
Without a hint of light
To watch the movement glow
When our song was slowly starting
Your memory felt so real
At first against my will
But God invented chills

Yeah I
I saw your ghost tonight
The moment felt so real
If your eyes stay right on mine
My wounds would start to heal

The kids are in a hurry
And I'm just full of fear
The lights make bodies blurry
It's getting hard enough to hear
It's like the evidence is cared for
And evidently clear
If I never leave this dance floor
I'll never leave you here

Yeah I
I saw your ghost tonight
The moment felt so real
If your eyes stay right on mine
My wounds would start to heal

I felt your ghost tonight
And God it felt like hell
To know you're almost mine
But dreams are all I feel

Yeah I
I saw your ghost tonight
It fucking hurt like hell
I felt you here tonight
But dreams can't all be real

I saw your ghost tonight
It fucking hurt like hell
I felt you here tonight
But dreams can't all be real

I'm like a cat in a cage, locked up and battered and bruised
I am the prodigal son, a shameful prodigy too
I am the love of your life, battering ram and confused
I turn each day into night, I stand there waiting for you
There is desire to fight, but I have nothing to prove
But with a crowd and some lights, I start to feel things move
Do you have something to hide? 'Cause I think that we all do
I am a child inside, back up and give me some room

I'm just a bastard child, don't let it go to your head
I'm just a waste of your time, maybe I'm better off dead
You turn us lose in the night, I'm fucking Jekyll and Hyde
We'll have the time of our lives although we're dying inside

So let me go, go
So let me go, go
Just let me go, go
I'd rather go it alone
So let me go, go
So let me go, go
Just let me go, go
I'm never coming home

Don't start to panic for me, 'cause I have nothing to lose
I am as bright as the sun, I burn up all that I choose
Upon the side of a field I see a city with lights
I touch her face and I kneel, she tells me she's not alive
I am too nervous to run, like kids who scatter and hide
To reach and grab for someone, but end up buried alive
A world is waiting for me, a road that I rarely use
I start to feel my feet, they kick down walls as they move

I'm just a bastard child, don't let it go to your head
I'm just a waste of your time, maybe I'm better off dead
You turn us lose in the night, I'm fucking Jekyll and Hyde
We'll have the time of our lives although we're dying inside

So let me go, go
So let me go, go
Just let me go, go
I'd rather go it alone
So let me go, go
So let me go, go
Just let me go, go
I'm never coming home

I'm just a bastard child, don't let it go to your head
I'm just a waste of your time, maybe I'm better off dead
You turn us lose in the night, I'm fucking Jekyll and Hyde
We'll have the time of our lives although we're dying inside

So let me go, go
So let me go, go
Just let me go, go
I'd rather go it alone
So let me go, go
So let me go, go
Just let me go, go
I'm never coming home

Everyone wants to call it all around our life with a better name
Everyone falls and spins and gets up again with a friend who does the same
Everyone lies and cheats their wants and needs and still believes their heart
And everyone gets the chills, the kind that kills, when the pain begins to start

Did I get this straight?
Do you want me here as I struggle through each and every year
And all these demons, they keep me up all night
They keep me up all night [x2]

Everyone's cross to bear is a crown they wear on endless holiday
Everyone raises kids in a world that changes life to a bitter game
Everyone works and fights, stays up all night to celebrate the day
And everyone lives to tell the tale of how we die alone some day

Did I get this straight?
Do you want me here as I struggle through each and every year
And all these demons, they keep me up all night
They keep me up all night [x3]
They keep me up all

I can't get my feet up off the edge
I kind of like the little rush you get
When you're standing close to death
Like when you're driving me crazy

Hold on as we crash into the earth
A bit of pain will help you suffer when you hurt, for real
'Cause you were driving me crazy

Bite your lips, your words a robbery
Do you grin inside? You're killing me
All along we talked of forever
I kind of think that we won't get better
It's the longest start, but the end's not too far away
Did you know I'm here to stay?

We'll stagger home after midnight
Sleep arm in arm in the stairwell
We'll fall apart on the weekend
These nights go on and on and on

I can't keep your voice out of my head
All I hear are the many echoes of
The darkest words you said
And it's driving me crazy

I can't find the best in all of this
But I'm always looking out for you
'Cause you're the one I miss
And it's driving me crazy

Bite your lips, your words a robbery
Do you grin inside? You're killing me
All along we talked of forever
I kind of think that we won't get better
It's the longest start, but the end's not too far away
Did you know I'm here to stay?

We'll stagger home after midnight
Sleep arm in arm in the stairwell
We'll fall apart on the weekend
These nights go on and on and on

We'll stagger home after midnight
Sleep arm in arm in the stairwell
We'll fall apart on the weekend
These nights go on and on and on

We'll stagger home after midnight
Sleep arm in arm in the stairwell
We'll fall apart on the weekend
These nights go on and on and on

We'll stagger home after midnight
Sleep arm in arm in the stairwell
We'll fall apart on the weekend
These nights go on and on and on

I felt a stutter and a waiver
Cutting like a razor
Like fire through the snow
Then straight down to the bone

She creeps up like a spider
Then wants you deep inside her
She turns you into stone
A twisted little show

That's how it was to all begin
'Cause good girls they like to sin
Way back at the starting line
When Eve was on Adam's mind
And he was the first to go
In search of the great unknown
And falling yet again
'Cause good girls they like to sin

You are a hero and survivor
Your eyes are getting tired
There's claw marks up your spine
It happens all the time
Those silent evil daughters
Like sirens on the water
You've been the perfect crime
It happens all the time

That's how it was to all begin
Cause good girls they like to sin
Way back at the starting line
When Eve was on Adam's mind
And he was the first to go
In search of the great unknown
And falling yet again
'Cause good girls they like to sin

Good girls they like to sin
Falling yet again
Good girls they like to sin
Good girls they like to sin

That's how it was to all begin
Cause good girls they like to sin
Way back at the starting line
When Eve was on Adam's mind
And he was the first to go
In search of the great unknown
And falling yet again
'Cause good girls they like to sin

Take off the gloves
We fell in love by the side of the road
This desert will break you down
The veins you cut
Your smoking tongue is the end of us all
But you only care about fame and fortune
Watching others tortured
Casting your reflection
Grocery store perfection
This is the last time
Sent to the front line with dirty boots on the ground
You said "I'll make this all mine"

You seemed so sweet at the start but the start's all wrong
You say you speak from your heart but your heart's all gone
Yeah your heart's all gone!

Blackjack and architect
Let's drink ourselves to death
The crimes of everyone
Passed down from father to son
Hopeless and destitute
Destroyed my gratitude
Your strongest lines of defense are all just self-inflicted wounds

You seemed so sweet at the start but the start's all wrong
You say you speak from your heart but your heart's all gone
You seemed so sweet at the start but the start's all wrong
You say you speak from your heart but your heart's all gone
Yeah your heart's all gone!

Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone

You seemed so sweet at the start but the start's all wrong
You say you speak from your heart but your heart's all gone
You seemed so sweet at the start but the start's all wrong
You say you speak from your heart but your heart's all gone
Yeah your heart's all gone!

Been gone a long time
I kind of lost my way, I can't find it
And I caught a short ride
To the grave and back this season
I can try to get by
But every time I start to panic
I'm a little bit shy
A bit strange and a little bit manic

La da da da, da da da da
La da da da, da da da da da
[x2]

I went to a wishing well, and sank to the ocean floor
Cut on the sharpened rocks, and washed up along the shore
I reached for a shooting star, it burned a hole through my hand
It made its way through my heart, have fun in the promise land

On the narrowing line, what a way to sort my troubles
In a very short time, gonna pop, better duck and cover
Can you figure me out? I got caught like a little kid stealing
Didn't say it too loud, A bit hard or a little misleading

La da da da, da da da da
La da da da, da da da da da
[x2]

I went to a wishing well, and sank to the ocean floor

Stop banging away on my kaleidoscope
Stop draining the color out of my scene
Just play me something I can dance to
I can dance to anything You wanna sing

So lock me up in the studio
Fill it up with sound and scenarios
Stop blocking the driveway with your car
Put the butterfly in the bell jar

It's the first time that I'm worried
Of a bad dream, of a journey
On the highway, through the valley
It's a long road through the night
It's a long road...

Hear a stranger's voice in the front yard
Let the hours tick past the deadline
Get another stamp in your passport
Wash your breakfast down with some red wine
Delete the progress on your game
Try to fall asleep while your ears ring
From the loudest songs on your mix tape
I can dance to anything you want to sing

No reason, no action, no silence, no help here
Nobody came running up by my side

It's the first time that I'm worried
Of a bad dream, of a journey
On the highway, through the valley
It's a long road through the night

It's the first time that I'm worried
Of a bad dream, of a journey
On the highway, through the valley
It's a long road through the night
It's a long road to get it right

We work and slave the day away
Were raised in perfect families
We fuck and fight like vagabonds
We dance like fucking animals
Don't stop, the band is coming on
Rude boys and punks will shout along
Police cars bring cuffs and loaded guns
Kids scream but laughing as they run

I hope
Do you wanna let go?
'Cause this is home

Gun shots, the punks are rioting
The stage is slowly crumbling
Smash doors and try to stay alive
A few drinks and a lot of broken lights
Go hide and call the cavalry
Let's dance in perfect harmony
Get close, the crowd will come apart
That girl will try to make you hard

I hope
Do you wanna let go?
Do you wanna this time?
I hope you wanna let go
'Cause this is home

I hope
Do you wanna let go?
Do you wanna this time?
I hope you wanna let go
'Cause this is home

Coming in, coming in, kill the radio silence
Break down in L.A.
Giving up, giving in to a feeling of violence
There's hell to pay

So let's light another match, stop living in the past
Where nobody can hear me now
Blow the lock off the cage, watch the children come of age
When their parents stop to take a bow

Nothing takes root in this barren soil
Nothing takes root in this barren soil
Maybe there's no one there at all

Hold on, the worst is yet to come
Save your money for hired guns
Hold strong when everything you loved is gone
Slow down, stop living in the shadow of a helicopter

Line 'em up on the wall, coming out with their hands up
Give 'em all the chair
Let it burn, let it fall, let the end of the world come
Who's left to care?

Nothing takes root in this barren soil
Nothing takes root, but we bend and toil
Maybe there's no one there at all

Hold on, the worst is yet to come
Save your money for hired guns
Hold strong when everything you loved is gone
Slow down, stop living in the shadow of a helicopter

Hold on, the worst is yet to come
Save your money for hired guns
Hold strong when everything you loved is gone
Slow down, stop living in the shadow of a helicopter

Stop living in the shadow of a helicopter

I've had it with this damn double vision
My hand swollen, I can't keep holding on
My heart's sinking and stuck in deadly rhythm
I can't fake it, I can't, can't brush it off

Love
Love is dangerous
Love
Love is so dangerous

I'm back at it, I just don't seem to listen
I see your lips, I just can't hear the sound
It's all static, Just like my television
Her skills sharpen, Her eyes cut through the clouds

I need Love
Love is dangerous
Hard times, don't be fooled when she says it's
Love
Love is so dangerous
(We'll betray the ones we care about)
Love (we care about)
Love is so dangerous
Life's cruel, so we all pretend to fuck
Love
Love is dangerous

(I need)
Love
Love is dangerous
(Hard times don't be fooled when she says it's)
Love
Love is so dangerous
(We'll betray the ones we care about)
Love (we care about)
Love is so dangerous
(Love's cruel, so we all pretend to fuck)
Love
Love is dangerous

This air is too thick to breathe
So just drive
These eyes are too sick to see
Don't leave me behind
Something's swimming in my blood
Something's rotting in my brain
When I'm smothered from the flood
I can't recognize your face
I need to leave
So just drive

Burning lights on the street
I'm fight-fighting the gravity
When I'm beat and defeated
They'll take you away from
Take-take you away from me
Dead and lost in a dream
Yes, this is the last of me
This-this is the last of me
I'm always fighting the gravity

Tonight is too much for me
To get through
Tomorrow's just a darkened hall
To an empty room
When I'm far away from you

Burning lights on the street
I'm fight-fighting the gravity
When I'm beat and defeated
They'll take you away from me
Take-take you away from me
Dead and lost in a dream
Yes, this is the last of me
This-this is the last of me
I'm always fighting the gravity
I'm always fighting the gravity

And she was like a starry night
Like a Ferris wheel, full of blue-green eyes
And a heart of steel, always on her own
Almost never real

When the night will begin
The pain it won't end, even if she falls in love
Back, you wanna turn back
Your heart will attack, even if she falls in love

And she was, like a blade of ice
Like a lonely road, clearest day alive
Always sharp and cold, always beautiful
I am such a fool

When the night will begin
The pain it won't end, even if she falls in love
Back, you wanna turn back
Your heart will attack, even if she falls in love

Try to look in her eyes
The light is just right, even if she falls in love
And it isn't so bad
It's driving you mad, even if she falls in love

When the night will begin
The pain it won't end, even if she falls in love
Back, you wanna turn back
Your heart will attack, even if she falls in love

Try to look in her eyes
The light is just right, even if she falls in love
And it isn't so bad
It's driving you mad, even if she falls in love

I woke up today surrounded by blackness
The small morning sun devoured the process
It's always been fun when I get a bit nervous
And it's hard to say but I feel a bit weightless
The more I admit I feel a bit anxious
The more I go on the less I can face this
And those rotten things that live in our shadow
We walk on the line of death and the gallows
And hope that we clear a path we can follow

It's the worst damn day
(It doesn't hurt that much)
Of my life
I made a mess today
(It doesn't hurt that much)
I'm alright
It doesn't hurt that much

When I was young the world it was smaller
The cities were vast the buildings were taller
I felt really strong my parents seemed stronger
But life has a way it showers with greatness
Then takes it away those pieces that made us
Then teaches you things you'd never imagine
We all get the same the memories the burdens
The pictures we made they still form a pattern
They cautiously say does it all matter

It's the worst damn day
(It doesn't hurt that much)
Of my life
I made a mess today
(It doesn't hurt that much)
I'm alright
It doesn't hurt that much

It's the worst damn day
(It doesn't hurt that much)
Of my life
I made a mess today
(It doesn't hurt that much)
I'm alright
It doesn't hurt that much

It's the worst damn day
(It doesn't hurt that much)
Of my life
I made a mess today
(It doesn't hurt that much)
I'm alright
It doesn't hurt that much

It's the worst damn day
(It doesn't hurt that much)
Of my life
I made a mess today
(It doesn't hurt that much)
I'm alright.

I've got a feeling, I've got a feeling
These broken nights and bitter ends
We would always starve and devour
Our closest friends my beautiful friends
Paranoia my paranoia
Can't let it go, it never lets me go
What am I feeling, why am I feeling
Forecast into the freezing cold

Dogs eating dogs, dogs eating dogs, dogs eating dogs
Dogs eating dogs, dogs eating dogs, dogs eating dogs

I'm the last and the first in a very sad set of eyes
To the bone, to the knees, to the factory line
I am numb to the shot, I have a crippling fear of heights
'Cause the fall sounds a lot like a symphony of cries

Your only hope is burning down the chapel
All getting washed out with the tide
We need to find some middle ground
It's always sex or suicide

Dogs eating dogs, dogs eating dogs, dogs eating dogs
Dogs eating dogs, dogs eating dogs, dogs eating dogs

I'm the last and the first in a very sad set of eyes
To the bone, to the knees, to the factory line
I am numb to the shot, I have a crippling fear of heights
'Cause the fall sounds a lot like a symphony of cries

Dogs eating dogs, dogs eating dogs, dogs eating dogs
Dogs eating dogs, dogs eating dogs, dogs eating dogs

I'm the last and the first in a very sad set of eyes
To the bone, to the knees, to the factory line
I am numb to the shot, I have a crippling fear of heights
'Cause the fall sounds a lot like a symphony of cries

Disaster, disaster
Disaster, disaster

Fall comes a loaded gun
Black ties for everyone
Can you read my mind
Fall in my arms again
Grey stones that break apart
French braids demonic art
The dead come alive
Fall in my arms again

Again
I'm scared of the dark my friends
What do you fear, my love?
Hold on you're breaking up

Disaster, disaster
Disaster, disaster

White stones of hollow eyes
Death comes you better hide
Never rest in town
Fall in my arms again
Full moon on a rotten night
Eighteen and a wind came by
Not a soul around
Fall in my arms again

Again
I'm scared of the dark my friends
What do you fear, my love?
Your soul it will float like a dove
Your words they will scream out our love
Your lips they will stutter with flavor
You can't shake the taste of the blood
Hold on you're breaking up
(Breaking up)

I'm scared of the dark my friends
What do you fear, my love?
Your soul it will float like a dove
Your words they will scream out our love
Your lips they will stutter with flavor
You can't shake the taste of the blood
Hold on you're breaking up
(Breaking up)

Let's get started the faint and broken hearted
Hold it up I've got something I cannot hide
Worst pain killer that all in filler
The apart and departed look in my eyes

It's sad how far you ran
I'll search this land up through the clouds
Then back here
We could reignite, like fireflies
Like an atom bomb at all hours

I'm empty like the day after Christmas
Swept beneath the wave of your goodbye
You left me on the day after Christmas
There's nothing left to say, and so
Goodnight

I will follow the trail to tomorrow
With my loneliness with sorrow
All through the night
Sons and daughters
Mothers and their fathers
Cross the bridges and the waters
For bruise left behind

It's sad how far you ran
I'll search this land up through the clouds
Then back here
We could reignite, like fireflies
Like an atom bomb at all hours

I'm empty like the day after Christmas
Swept beneath the wave of your goodbye
You left me on the day after Christmas
There's nothing left to say, and so

There's nothing left to say, and so
Goodnight

Goodnight

Nineteen, your eyes are glowing to my beating heart
Oh, it seems like it is fine as my hand is moving up your arm
And you never really know where it goes up until it starts
I got my eye on you
What you gonna do

Day dream near a stream with the linear bites
Oh, I listen to the song on repeat from the other night
And I can't picture you but I sure got the feeling right
What a crazy world
Pretty little girl

And we wake from the night in a bed with a bruise
And we're laughing out loud over the craziest news
And you reached for my hand I was scared in your room
We fell on the floor and we started to move
And your hands were like birds as they flew from the coop
Up my back they would climb just as I came unglued

She said
If you break my heart then I'll change your mind
And I will do it again
If you play the part then I will play mine
And I will do it again
If we miss the mark if we hold on tight
We'll be there to try it again

Nineteen as we roll across the bedroom floor
Your eyes they cannot lie as you're dreaming of our future home
And the kids are growing up as you and I we are growing old
What a crazy world
Pretty little girl

In the rain with the drink from the back of the bar
I would raise up my voice, you would raise it up more
We'd forget that our lives being apart it is hard
We'd thought we were close but it still feels far
Can we learn to get by if we learn to have scars
If we learn to forgive and accept who we are

You said
If you break my heart then I'll change your mind
And I will do it again
If you play the part then I will play mine
And I will do it again
If we miss the mark if we hold on tight
We'll be here to do it again

[Yelawolf:]
Wait a minute hold up a second
Don't leave me here with this feeling
Like I'm the one full of regret
Like I never did good for us both
Like you never did pull out that weapon
And stick that knife in my back
Was I supposed to accept it
When your words are like
More than just sticks and stones
Kinda like a bullet
A hollow tip that lodged in my bones
And I can't just swallow it
My pride is more than all that I own
So I gotta give it away
And some of the times I'm all the way wrong
But can't you see past me and see my fucked up home
That made me the meanest, the devil is just singing along
To the song I write til I'm alone at night
And I hang up the phone and bite my tongue
Cause I know that me and you is just only right
But one one one one

It's a cry from the past we have been through a lot
Every year has been great and a few have been tough
And your kids they will reach for the stars up above
We'll sit and relax as we're cheering them on
The ropes to the light from the crib to the grave
We started alone in the end we're okay

You said
If you break my heart then I'll change your mind
And I will do it again
If you play the part then I will play mine
And I will do it again
If we miss the mark if we hold on tight
We'll be here to try it again

There's a cynical feeling saying I should give up
You said everything you'll ever say
There's a moment of panic when I hear the phone ring
Anxiety's calling in my head

Is it back again?
Are you back again?

Don't wake me up before you leave
Is there the slightest trace of what you once believed
I feel your hand unlock the door
Leaving fingerprints of water in the oil

What's the point of saying sorry now
Lost my voice while fighting my way out (while fighting my way out)

What's the point of saying sorry now (not sorry, not sorry, not sorry, I'm not sorry)
Lost my voice while fighting my way out (not sorry, not sorry, not sorry, I'm not sorry now)

There's an echo pulling out the meaning
Rescuing a nightmare from a dream
The voices in my head are always screaming
That none of this means anything to me

And it's a long way back from seventeen
The whispers turn into a scream
And I, I'm not coming home

Save your breath, I'm nearly
Bored to death and fading fast
Life is too short to last long
Back on Earth, I'm broken
Lost and cold and fading fast
Life is too short to last long

There's a stranger staring at the ceiling
Rescuing a tiger from a tree
The pictures in her head are always dreaming
Each of them means everything to me

And it's a long way back from seventeen
The whispers turn into a scream
And I, I'm not coming home

Save your breath, I'm nearly
Bored to death and fading fast
Life is too short to last long
Back on Earth, I'm broken
Lost and cold and fading fast
Life is too short to last long

Oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh

(Oh oh, oh oh)
I think I met her at the minute that the rhythm was set down
(Oh oh, oh oh)
I said I'm sorry I'm a bit of a letdown
(Oh oh, oh oh)
But all my friends are daring me to come over
(Oh oh, oh oh)
So I come over and over and over
(Oh oh, oh oh)
So let me buy you a drink and we'll pretend that you think
(Oh oh, oh oh)
That I'm the man of your dreams come to life in a dive bar
(Oh oh, oh oh)
And we'll go over and over and over
(Oh oh, oh oh)
And we'll go over and over and over
(Oh oh, oh oh)
And we'll go over and over and over
(Oh oh, oh oh)
And we'll go over and over and over

Save your breath, I'm nearly
Bored to death and fading fast
Life is too short to last long
Back on Earth, I'm broken
Lost and cold and fading fast
Life is too short to last long

Oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
(Life is too short to last long)
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh

I said settle down, settle down everything is fine
Take your eyes off the floor
She said no I'm not, no I'm not, no I'm not alright
I lost my head on the door

She's a-a-a-antisocial
A-a-a-antisocial
A-a-a
She's an angel yeah

I'm in deep with this girl but she's out of her mind (wooo oh oh ohhh oh)
She said babe I'm sorry but I'm crazy tonight (wooo oh oh ohhh oh)
She got a black shirt, black skirt and Bauhaus stuck in her head
I'm in deep with this girl but she's out of her mind (wooo oh oh ohhh oh)

Oh yeah
We all need something to live for
Yeah
We all need something to live for

She said I let her down, let her down I no longer dream
Of anything anymore
Said I'm a know-it-all, know-it-all you make me want to scream
And threw herself on the floor

She's a-a-a-antisocial
A-a-a-antisocial
A-a-a
She's an angel yeah

I'm in deep with this girl but she's out of her mind (wooo oh oh ohhh oh)
She said babe I'm sorry but I'm crazy tonight (wooo oh oh ohhh oh)
She got a black shirt, black skirt and Bauhaus stuck in her head
I'm in deep with this girl but she's out of her mind (wooo oh oh ohhh oh)

She's not complicated
Can't be overstated at all
She's not complicated-ated-ated at all

I'm in deep with this girl but she's out of her mind (wooo oh oh ohhh oh) (she's out of her mind)
She said babe I'm sorry but I'm crazy tonight (wooo oh oh ohhh oh)
She got a black shirt, black skirt and Bauhaus stuck in her head
I'm in deep with this girl but she's out of her mind (wooo oh oh ohhh oh)

Oh yeah
We all need something to live for
Yeah
We all need something to live for

Day in day out
Up at 3 AM with the searchlights shining down
Day in day out
It's the blinding light underneath the dirt downtown
Whoa
Listen to the sound as they bomb the Sixth Street Bridge
Whoa
Listen to the sound of the voices south of Fifth

In Los Angeles when will you save me
Los Angeles when will you save me
Los Angeles when will you save me
Los Angeles I'm never coming home
(I'm never coming, I'm never coming)

Come down
I've been awake for days
Knocked out
By the sound of falling rain
Come down yeah we'll watch the sun just burn away the sky
Watch the city lights die out up on Mulholland Drive

Los Angeles when will you save me
Los Angeles when will you save me
Los Angeles when will you save me
Los Angeles I'm never coming home

Wake me when this war is over
Meet me where the skylight ends
Wake me when this war is over
Meet me where the skylight ends
Wake me when this war is over
Meet me where the skylight ends

Los Angeles when will you save me
Los Angeles when will you save me
Los Angeles when will you save me
Los Angeles I'm never coming home

I'm never coming home
I'm never coming home
I'm never coming home
I'm never coming home

I know I messed up and it might be over
But let me call you when I'm sober
I'm a dandelion, you're a four-leaf clover
But let me call you when I'm sober

Naa, na na na na na naaaa
na na na na na na
Naa, na na na na na naaaa
na na na na na na

I woke up in the pouring rain
West Side Humboldt 7am
Sleeping by a dumpster to keep me dry
With the radio on and a new black eye

Because I bet you couldn't knock me out
And I guess you really got me now
Black sedan ran a red light
Just a drunken bike messenger on Tuesday night

I know I messed up and it might be over
But let me call you when I'm sober
I'm a dandelion, you're a four-leaf clover
But let me call you when I'm sober

Naa, na na na na na naaaa
na na na na na na (when I'm sober)
Naa, na na na na na naaaa
na na na na na na (when I'm sober)

She undressed and we stumbled downstairs
Fell onto the table as the neighbors just stared
We laughed out loud and smashed their lights
Digging with our hands in the dirt outside

And she dragged me to the edge of town
And she slapped me then she pulled me down
I can do bad and you can do better
Spending all night getting lost together

I know I messed up and it might be over
But let me call you when I'm sober
I'm a dandelion, you're a four-leaf clover
But let me call you when I'm sober

Sober...
Sober...

I know I messed up and it might be over
But let me call you when I'm sober
I'm a dandelion, you're a four-leaf clover
But let me call you when I'm sober

Naa, na na na na na naaaa
na na na na na na (when I'm sober)
Naa, na na na na na naaaa
na na na na na na (when I'm sober)

Naa, na na na na na naaaa
na na na na na na (when I'm sober)
Naa, na na na na na naaaa
na na na na na na (when I'm sober)

Woo, woo
I wanna see some naked dudes
That's why I built this pool

Is that really it?

She said "Tonight's a waste of time"
The next day, the sun will always rise
Every day that you waste, every promise you break
Slips beneath the floor
It's a permanent state from a moments mistake
But life's worth so much more

You don't know a thing about it
Hours lost to dawn from dusk
Yeah, they don't care about you (No future)
Let the music seal your fate
Yeah, you can run but life won't wait
Yeah, they don't care about you (No future)

She said that it's too late to try
Someday, I'll smile and say goodbye
Every night that you fight, every demon in sight
Sleeping on the floor
Wide awake from the dream with a shake and a scream
Hope for so much more

You don't know a thing about it
Hours lost to dawn from dusk
Yeah, they don't care about you (No future)
Let the music seal your fate
Yeah, you can run but life won't wait
Yeah, they don't care about you (No future)

Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
They don't care about you
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
They don't care about you

Where did she go?
And what did she hope to find there?
Where did she go? (Did she go, did she go?)
And what did she hope to find there?
Where did she go, did she go, did she go?
Where did she go to find there?
Where did she go, did she go, did she go?
Where did she go to find there?

You don't know a thing about it
Hours lost to dawn from dusk
Yeah, they don't care about you (No future)
Let the music seal your fate
Yeah, you can run but life won't wait
Yeah, they don't care about you (No future)

Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
They don't care about you
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
They don't care about you

We're falling faster than we can fly
Forgotten seconds out on Sunset Drive
And I hold on tight
But not enough to hold you back

It feels like the moon
Is spinning off into outer space without you
This room is such a lonely place without you

I wish that we could save today
But I know we can't stay the same
And I keep pushing you away
Don't wait for me
Don't wait for me

Home is such a lonely place without you
Home is such a lonely place

I love the lightning but hate the rain
Tomorrow's frightening but not today
Wish I could slow down time
But not enough to slow you down

I feel like the moon
Is spinning off into outer space without you
The universe an empty place without you

I wish that we could save today
But I know we can't stay the same
And I keep pushing you away
Don't wait for me
Don't wait for me

Home is such a lonely place without you
Home is such a lonely place

We're falling faster than we can fly
Forgotten seconds out on Sunset Drive

I wish that we could save today
But I know we can't stay the same
And I keep pushing you away
Don't wait for me
Don't wait for me

I wish that we could save today
But I know we can't stay the same
And I keep pushing you away
Don't wait for me
Don't wait for me

Home is such a lonely place without you
Home is such a lonely place

Home is such a lonely place

Can you read my thoughts
I'm not sure what I said
I feel dumb and
Long night coming

Did you steal my prayers
I don't know where I was
I feel numb and
All or nothing (all or nothing)

It's Friday night let's lose our minds
In a downward spiral
Here we go
Because we got no control (no control)

It's Friday nights always save my life
From the worst of times
We ever had
Thank God for punk rock bands

Until Monday morning strikes again
We are the kings of the weekend

I can feel my head
Falling off my neck
I need something
To keep going

So just take my hand
Only seconds left
The clock's running
Our time's coming

Aww!

It's Friday night let's lose our minds
In a downward spiral
Here we go
Because we got no control (no control)

It's Friday nights always save my life
From the worst of times
We ever had
Thank God for punk rock bands

Until Monday morning strikes again
We are the kings of the weekend

It's Friday night let's lose our minds
In a downward spiral
Here we go
Because we got no control (no control)

It's Friday nights always save my life
From the worst of times
We ever had
Thank God for punk rock bands

Until Monday morning strikes again
We are the kings of the weekend

I can almost see your house from here
But the signal seems to disappear so what's the problem? Houston's calling
Then you hit me like a Friday night
Like a handgun in a firefight dive in slow motion towards the ocean

Let's run away
Let's go and waste another year
Let's spin apart
While racing through the atmosphere
We tumble through the night
We burn so bright
We're teenage satellites

Woo oh oh oh oh oh oh
Woo oh oh oh oh oh oh

I'm kind of nervous of the consequence
As we climb over the neighbor's fence the longest summer's nights are numbered
Then you kissed me like a storm at sea
Like I'm the only one you'll ever need we're left abandoned in the deep end

Let's run away
Let's go and waste another year
Let's spin apart
While racing through the atmosphere
We tumble through the night
We burn so bright
We're teenage satellites

(We're teenage satellites)

We are a slow descent
Forgotten astronauts
We are an avalanche
We're just an afterthought

Let's run away
Let's go and waste another year
Let's spin apart
While racing through the atmosphere
We tumble through the night
We burn so bright
We're teenage satellites

Woo oh oh oh oh oh oh
Woo oh oh oh oh oh oh
Teenage satellites
Woo oh oh oh oh oh oh
Teenage satellites
Woo oh oh oh oh oh oh
Teenage satellites

Eyes are open words are spoken
Here's to the sunrise
Head is loaded cards are folded
Under the moonlight

Can you remember, you remember the last time
We woke up sober
Can you remember, you remember the last night
You ran me over

Are we halfway gone or halfway there

Left alone
We're only halfway home
Sink like stones
Fall into the unknown

Break me down, I'm not afraid of you
Pull me under
Slowly drown, I never wanted to
Left alone to wonder

Mind is open thoughts are woken
There goes the sunrise
Heart is broken love unspoken
Here comes the moonlight

Can you remember, you remember the last time
I left hungover
Can you remember, you remember the last night
That I stayed over

Are we halfway gone or halfway there

Left alone
We're only halfway home
Sink like stones
Fall into the unknown

Break me down, I'm not afraid of you
Pull me under
Slowly drown, I never wanted to
Left alone to wonder

Woo oh ohh
We're left alone
Woo oh ohh oh

Woo oh ohh
We're left alone
Woo oh ohh oh

Woo oh ohh
We're left alone
Woo oh ohh oh

Woo oh ohh
We're left alone
Woo oh ohh oh

Left alone
We're only halfway home
Sink like stones
Fall into the unknown

Break me down, I'm not afraid of you
Pull me under
Slowly drown, I never wanted to
Left alone to wonder

Woo oh ohh
We're left alone
Woo oh ohh oh

Woo oh ohh
We're left alone
Woo oh ohh oh

Woo oh ohh
We're left alone
Woo oh ohh oh

Woo oh ohh
We're left alone
Woo oh ohh oh

Dear head, shut up
I can't listen no more
It's late, so shut up
Is one night too much to ask for

You are a haunted house
You're superstitious
You are the coldest stone-carved marble faces

I won't fall down that fucking rabbit hole
I'm barely standing on the ground
All the hints that you leave are too hard to believe at all
I won't fall down that fucking rabbit hole

With you, with you, with you, with you again
With you, with you, with you, with you again

This bed, on fire
I can't sleep here no more
Too late and tired
Dreaming down on the floor

I'm a haunted house
I'm superstitious
I am a cardboard cutout, old and faded

I won't fall down that fucking rabbit hole
I'm barely standing on the ground
All the hints that you leave are too hard to believe at all
I won't fall down that fucking rabbit hole

With you, with you, with you, with you again
With you, with you, with you, with you again

With you, with you, with you, with you again
With you, with you, with you, with you again

I won't fall down that fucking rabbit hole (I won't fall down, I won't fall down)
I'm barely standing on the ground (Barely standing on the ground)
All the hints that you leave are too hard to believe at all
I won't fall down that fucking rabbit hole (I won't fall down that fucking rabbit hole)

Oh, oh [x6]
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Sometimes I wonder where our lives go
And question who we used to be
Sometimes I feel like I'm the oxygen between
The cigarette and gasoline

I can't sleep cause what if I dream

Of going back to San Diego
We bought a one way ticket
So we can go see the Cure
And listen to our favorite songs in the parking lot
And think of every person I ever lost in San Diego
(To San Diego)
Can't go back to San Diego
(Can't go back to San Diego)

Abandoned houses with the lights on
Late at night I call your name
Abandoned love songs smashed across the hardwood floors
I read the sadness on your face

I can't sleep cause what if I dream

Of going back to San Diego
We bought a one way ticket
So we can go see the Cure
And listen to our favorite songs in the parking lot
And think of every person I ever lost in San Diego
(To San Diego)
Can't go back to San Diego
(Can't go back to San Diego)

I never needed to hear
All of the pain and the fear
Your secrets filled up my ears
Like the ocean blue
I never wanted to know
How deep these cuts on you go
And like a river they flow
To the ocean blue

Going back to San Diego
We bought a one way ticket
So we can go see the Cure
And listen to our favorite songs in the parking lot
And think of every person I ever lost in San Diego (San Diego)
(To San Diego)
Can't go back to San Diego (San Diego)
(Can't go back to San Diego)

Where the hell did you come from
Outer space or heaven above
Short of breath my long-lost love
I can't believe my eyes
Are you for real?

My life before was such a mess
There's no use dwelling on the past
My broken heart was in a cast
Then you showed up and it began to heal

'Cause you're the only thing that matters
'Cause you're the only thing that's real
'Cause you're the only thing I'll never let go
'Cause you're the only thing I feel

Someday
You'll come back to me
And I'll say
Something bitterly

And you'll go racing toward the kitchen
Grab a knife erase my vision
Take my flatscreen television
And my paintings by Marilyn Manson

'Cause you're the only thing that matters
'Cause you're the only thing that's real
'Cause you're the only thing I'll never let go
'Cause you're the only thing I feel

'Cause you're the only thing that matters
'Cause you're the only thing that's real
'Cause you're the only thing I'll never let go
'Cause you're the only thing I feel

Beige little boxes in a row
Neighbors and friends that you don't know
Here's a form go wait in line
Can't you see I'm doing fine
It's what I've always wanted

Two little kids out on the lawn
Once we had love now it's gone
Good things haven't happened yet
I'm empty as a movie set
It's what I've always wanted

Hey here's to you California
Beautiful haze of suburbia
Living in the perfect weather
Spending time inside together
Hey here's to you California

Wearing all black out on the beach
Faces I've seen in magazines
Lets take a walk out on the pier
Watch the shoreline disappear
It's what I've always wanted

Hey here's to you California
Beautiful haze of suburbia
Living in the perfect weather
Spending time inside together
Hey here's to you California

Na, na na, na na, na na, na na (woah ohh)
Na, na na, na na, na na, na na (woah ohh)
Na, na na, na na, na na, na na (woah ohh)
Na, na na, na na, na na, na na (woah ohh)

Hey here's to you California
Beautiful haze of suburbia
Living in the perfect weather
Spending time inside together
Hey here's to you California

There's something about you
That I can't quite put my finger in

Remember the days
we would drink on the train
on our way to the show, Chicago
Naked Raygun live at the Cabaret Metro
Ten bucks to get into a fight you can't win
Boots and braces, yellow laces
Oxblood traces of the night before

We are forgotten young suburbia
Loose on the streets of California
Underneath fluorescent lights
We'll waste the best nights of our lives
Fuck this place, let's put up a parking lot
Na, na na, na na, na na
Na, na na, na na, na na
Fuck this place, let's put up a parking lot

I can't wait 'til I'm off of work
I'll meet my friends at the Target curb
I rolled my ankle, Matt just broke his wrist
I climbed through your window at 3am
We listened to The Smiths and The Violent Femmes
Yeah, we both sang, "Why can't I get one kiss?"

We are forgotten young suburbia
Loose on the streets of California
Underneath fluorescent lights
We'll waste the best nights of our lives
Fuck this place, let's put up a parking lot

We are the broken
No end in sight
We're the forgotten soldiers you left behind
There's no use trying
We lost the war
Now the dead and dying
Are back to even the score

We are forgotten young suburbia
Loose on the streets of California
Underneath fluorescent lights
We'll waste the best nights of our lives
Fuck this place, let's put up a parking lot
Na, na na, na na, na na
Na, na na, na na, na na
Fuck this place, let's put up a parking lot

I'm a wreck, I'm out of time
I barely made it out alive
I'm not bent, I'm not cracked
I'm just broken
I watched the fire burn the sea
I wrapped my car around a tree
Pulled me up, underneath
This heavy burden

There's a halo in the distance
Salvation's barely out of reach

Torn apart like the brokenhearted
Up in smoke with the fire we started
Misery loves company
I don't need anyone
Smash it up like there's no tomorrow
Leave me here with the fear and sorrow
Misery loves company
I don't need anyone

Tied up to a heart of stone
I screamed into a microphone
I burned the bridge, so I won't
Find my way home
Lay with me, I can't sleep
Misery loves company
When I'm bent, when I'm cracked
When I'm broken

There's a halo in the distance
Salvation's barely out of reach (out of reach)

Torn apart like the brokenhearted
Up in smoke with the fire we started
Misery loves company
I don't need anyone
Smash it up like there's no tomorrow
Leave me here with the fear and sorrow
Misery loves company
I don't need anyone

I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone

Fifteen times a night, when the sun's gone down
In the dark awake, and you're not around
And the closest thought is the edge of oblivion
Fifteen times a day when you check your phone
And I won't be there and you're all alone
'Cause we always lived on the edge of oblivion
Left to find our way through a Hitchcock film
In an empty bed with an hour to kill
'Cause it's only fun on the edge of oblivion (oblivion)

Torn apart like the brokenhearted
Up in smoke with the fire we started
Misery loves company
I don't need anyone
Smash it up like there's no tomorrow
Leave me here with the fear and sorrow
Misery loves company
I don't need anyone

I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone

Don't wanna hear the static on the TV screen
Don't wanna live a life of cellphone memories

When did you go missing?
Where did I go wrong?
Sometimes I just don't know where I belong

Save yourself, we're always saying
We're not the same, we're two in a million
These are the good old days
These are the good old days
Gone through hell, the battles we fought in
We stood as one, the young and forgotten
These are the good old days
These are the good old days

You're not the only one who grew up feeling scared
You're not the only broken heart gone unrepaired

Everyone's gone missing
Everyone's done wrong
Sometimes we both fly too close to the sun

Save yourself, we're always saying
We're not the same, we're two in a million
These are the good old days
These are the good old days
Gone through hell, the battles we fought in
We stood as one, the young and forgotten
These are the good old days
These are the good old days

You're giving up, we're getting out
We were young and we're not growing up
We're not growing up

You're giving up, we're getting out
We were young and we're not growing up
We're not growing up

Save yourself, we're always saying
We're not the same, we're two in a million
These are the good old days
These are the good old days
Gone through hell, the battles we fought in
We stood as one, the young and forgotten
These are the good old days
These are the good old days

These are the good old days
These are the good old days

These are the good old days
These are the good old days

Dearest mom
I'm always here, no matter how far gone
I'm alright without you
And late at night
A million thoughts are caught up in my tree
You're alright without me

It don't mean, it don't mean
It don't mean anything at all
It don't mean, it don't mean
It don't mean anything at all
And it's a long way back to the middle of the road
Fighting our way back home
It don't mean, it don't mean
It don't mean anything at all

Dear old dad
I'm the one and only son you never had
I'll be fine without you
Late at night
I hear you grab your coat and your car keys
You'll be fine without me
No!

It don't mean, it don't mean
It don't mean anything at all
It don't mean, it don't mean
It don't mean anything at all
And it's a long way back to the middle of the road
Fighting our way back home
It don't mean, it don't mean
It don't mean anything at all

When we all fall to the surface sometimes
And we all fall back where we belong
And we all fall to the surface sometimes
And we all fall back where we belong

It don't mean, it don't mean
It don't mean anything at all
It don't mean, it don't mean
It don't mean anything at all
And it's a long way back to the middle of the road
Fighting our way back home
It don't mean, it don't mean
It don't mean anything at all

Whoa-oh whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh whoa-oh-oh

Hold me down deep under water
Wave goodbye to all your daughters
Break yourself but why even bother?
Fathers pray for princes instead

Have your fill of disappointment
Two more years of unemployment
All your fears come to life
And leave you boarded up, abandoned and spent

Everything you ever hoped for
Waiting there outside your front door
Bleeding to death (bleeding to death)
Everything you never wanted
Here to stay just like that haunted place
They save for everyone's dying breath

Hey I'm sorry, I lost the melody
Whoa-ah-oh
Hey I'm sorry, I lost your memory
Whoa-ah-oh
When we fall asleep I sleep all by myself
At the end of the day

Are you alone with all your thoughts?
Your suitcase full of books you bought
The war we fought and all the battles lost
And sought as such exceeding expense

Everything you ever hoped for
Waiting there outside your front door
Bleeding to death (bleeding to death)
Everything you never wanted
Here to stay just like that haunted place
They save for everyone's dying breath

Hey I'm sorry, I lost the melody
Whoa-ah-oh
Hey I'm sorry, I lost your memory
Whoa-ah-oh
When we fall asleep I sleep all by myself
At the end of the day

Whoa-oh whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh whoa-oh-oh

Hey I'm sorry, I lost the melody
Whoa-ah-oh
Hey I'm sorry, I lost your memory
Whoa-ah-oh

Hey I'm sorry, I lost the melody
Hey I'm sorry, I lost your memory
Hey I'm sorry, mistakes and tragedy
Hey I'm sorry, give back what's left of me
When I fall asleep I sleep all by myself
At the end of the day

Whoa-oh whoa-oh-oh
At the end of the day
Whoa-oh whoa-oh-oh

Late at night on Mercy Street
The summer air is way too sweet
The way I feel inside is worse than poison
Washed up standing on a beach
Something inside is incomplete
I numb the pain for one more night of mourning

This is the one last time
I promise one last time

I'll take the last train home (The last train home)
I'll take the last train home (The last train home)
I'll take the last train home
The only time I feel alive is when I find something I would die for
(The last train home)
I'll take the last train home
The only time I feel alive is when I find something I would die for
(The last train home)

The tidal wave and aftermath
I'm seasick from the years we passed
Adrift at sea with no one left to rescue
Tonic and a fifth of gin
She said goodbye and left again
These empty rooms are deafening without you

This is the one last time
I promise one last time

I'll take the last train home (The last train home)
I'll take the last train home (The last train home)
I'll take the last train home
The only time I feel alive is when I find something I would die for
(The last train home)
I'll take the last train home
The only time I feel alive is when I find something I would die for
(The last train home)

Life's so strange
Time won't change
The world slips by, unafraid
And she never cared much anyway
Life's so strange

I'll take the last train home (The last train home)
I'll take the last train home (The last train home)
I'll take the last train home
The only time I feel alive is when I find something I would die for
(The last train home)
I'll take the last train home
The only time I feel alive is when I find something I would die for
(The last train home)

I could never own up, I need to speak up
I don't want to grow up, don't want to end up
Caught in a landslide with the other side
Living for the paycheck, dying for the weekend
Take another Xanax, cheating on your girlfriend
Taking your last breath, counting down the time

Don't tell me it's too late, I'm stuck at heaven's gate
Strike a match and start a wildfire
I'll own all my mistakes, won't give you what you take
Watch you burning in the wildfire

They said I'd never make it (Watching me fall)
All the time I wasted (Learning to crawl)
From the ashes as this world comes crashing down

Don't tell me it's too late, I'm stuck at heaven's gate
Strike a match and start a wildfire
I'll own all my mistakes, won't give you what you take
Watch you burning in the wildfire

We won this war, we cursed and swore
They stood no chance at all (The underdogs came home)
We won this war, we cursed and swore
They stood no chance at all

I don't forget, I don't forgive
I'll never change the way I live
I always fought the urge to fall in line
I turned my back on all the rules
I'll never heed the king of fools
I'll never lead the perfect kind of life

I don't forget, I don't forgive (We won this war)
I'll never change the way I live (We cursed and swore)
I always fought the urge to fall in line (They stood no chance at all)
I turned my back on all the rules (We won this war)
I'll never heed the king of fools (We cursed and swore)
I'll never lead the perfect kind of life (They stood no chance at all)

The underdogs came home

You live in a world I cannot believe
You create a world I don't want to see
And your forest's a stand of dead trees lost in the night

Did you ever think you'd live down the past?
You just wanna tie yourself to the mast
All your nightmares have come to you at last, at least in your mind

Learn to swim in rushing rivers breaking on the shore
Make your peace with broken streets
Your face turned towards the storm

(This shitty guitar needs some personality)
(This shitty song needs some personality)

Your hallow accusations no one ever hears
Your wounded sense of pride, a guilty souvenir
All your protests and vacant excuses ring insincere

(This song needs some fucking personality)

I just want to find a car to overturn
I just want to light a fire and watch it burn
Now we're past the point of no return and no one is here

Learn to swim in rushing rivers breaking on the shore
Make your peace with broken streets
Your face turned towards the storm

(This song needs some fucking personality)
(Anybody? Personality?)
(Give me some fucking personality)
(What happened to personality?)

You are afraid, uneducated on where this would lead
Going on for far too long
We are sorry for the greed
Leave us in pieces and places
War torn and wronged

In between whispers and screams
You permeate my soul
Lost between nightmares and dreams
You decimate this home

Learn to swim in rushing rivers breaking on the shore
Make your peace with broken streets
Your face turned towards the storm

(How do I look? Disappointing)
(How about I disappoint them more?)
(I am a disappointment)
(How about I disappoint them more?)

Made a wish on a mountain top
But an avalanche came and washed away
Wrote a song on an old guitar
But the words were wrong, they make you walk away

Said I could have anything I want forevermore
Said I could be anyone I want but I was bored

Every day turns into sleepless nights
My head is spinning with the sadness of a long lost feeling
Golden years where I would smash the mirrors
My head is spinning with the sadness of a long lost feeling

Found a wreck on the ocean floor
Like a tidal wave you washed it all away
Heard a song on the radio
All the words were right, they made me wanna stay

Said I could have anything I want forevermore
Said I could be anyone I want but I was bored

Every day turns into sleepless nights
My head is spinning with the sadness of a long lost feeling
Golden years where I would smash the mirrors
My head is spinning with the sadness of a long lost feeling

Say goodbye until it hurts
Stormy skies and fireworks
Say goodbye until it hurts
Stormy skies and fireworks
Say goodbye until it hurts
Stormy skies and fireworks

Here nights are foggy and weird
Everyone I trusted disappears
Breathing life into my deepest fears
Take, now there's nothing to take
Now you're haunted by your worst mistakes
Watch me sinking underneath the waves

I don't want to drink about it (stare it down)
Drowning down at 3 AM (no way out)
Water's cold, my mind is clouded (and then I woke up choking)
How'd I make it here again? (too much, too much to take)

Days, I've been like this for days
Hiding underneath the darkest waves
I've been praying for the tide to change
Head, is this all in my head?
Running over every word I said
When they finally found my note it read

If you need me
I'll be lying here at the bottom of the ocean
If you need me
I'll be right here

Air, leave it up in the air
'Cause the people on the ground don't care
They don't notice but it's everywhere
Chase, now there's nothing to chase
Every day I feel so out of place
Let me wash away without a trace

I don't want to drink about it (stare it down)
Drowning down at 3 AM (no way out)
Water's cold, my mind is clouded (and then I woke up choking)
How'd I make it here again? (too much, too much to take)

Days, I've been like this for days
Hiding underneath the darkest waves
I've been praying for the tide to change
Head, is this all in my head?
Running over every word I said
When they finally found my note it read

If you need me
I'll be lying here at the bottom of the ocean
If you need me
I'll be right here

I'm out here in the deep end
I'm lower than I've ever been
I burn it down, it turns to smoke
And when I see the morning
It's colder than it's ever been
My bloodshot eyes see through the smoke

Days, I've been like this for days
Hiding underneath the darkest waves
I've been praying for the tide to change
Head, is this all in my head?
Running over every word I said
When they finally found my note it read

If you need me
I'll be lying here at the bottom of the ocean
If you need me
I'll be right here

I, I can't get you more pregnant
But if you're worried at all
I can take care of myself
I can take care of myself

There's an echo pulling out the meaning
Rescuing a nightmare from a dream
The voices in my head are always screaming
That none of this means anything to me

And it's a long way back from seventeen
The whispers turn into a scream
And I, I'm not coming home

Save your breath, I'm nearly
Bored to death and fading fast
Life is too short to last long
Back on Earth, I'm broken
Lost and cold and fading fast
Life is too short to last long

There's a stranger staring at the ceiling
Rescuing a tiger from a tree
The pictures in Mark's head are always dreaming
Each of them means everything to me

And it's a long way back from seventeen
The whispers turn into a scream
And I, I'm not coming home

Save your breath, I'm nearly
Bored to death and fading fast
Life is too short to last long
Back on Earth, I'm broken
Lost and cold and fading fast
Life is too short to last long

Oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh

(Oh oh, oh oh)
I think I met her at the minute that the rhythm was set down
(Oh oh, oh oh)
I said I'm sorry I'm a bit of a letdown
(Oh oh, oh oh)
But all my friends are daring me to come over
(Oh oh, oh oh)
So I come over and over and over
(Oh oh, oh oh)
So let me buy you a drink and we'll pretend that you think
(Oh oh, oh oh)
That I'm the man of your dreams come to life in a dive bar
(Oh oh, oh oh)
And we'll go over and over and over
(Oh oh, oh oh)
And we'll go over and over and over
(Oh oh, oh oh)
And we'll go over and over and over
(Oh oh, oh oh)
And we'll go over and over and over

Save your breath, I'm nearly
Bored to death and fading fast
Life is too short to last long
Back on Earth, I'm broken
Lost and cold and fading fast
Life is too short to last long

Oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
(Life is too short to last long)
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh

First drink of the night just to get me right
The first light of the day, I know I got it all wrong
First pill that you drop only sets it off
The next morning you wake up all blurry and numb

Before all the damn insecurities
Before all your innocence is all lost
Think back to the time you were all alone
One day you'll look back and say, "where's it all gone?"

[Mark Hoppus, (Matt Skiba):]
Sometimes we get lost inside our little heads
Don't sleep, just yet, we all know that there's nothing like the
(First love, first high, there ain't nothing like the first time
Passed out, last night, there ain't nothing like the first time)

Taking all the meds (First love)
Sleeping with your friends (First high)
Find out in the end, there ain't (There ain't)
Nothing like the first time (Nothing like the first time)
Stuck inside her head (Passed out)
Jumping in her bed (Last night)
Find out in the end, there ain't (There ain't)
Nothing like the first time (Nothing like the first time)

First time on a plane, so she's paranoid
Tried to make her feel safe, but said it all wrong
First time in L.A., so she can't avoid
Feeling like she's failing all along

Hey kid, don't quit your daydream yet
I know you feel locked out in the cold
Seems like you're lost and alone
Hey kid, don't listen to your head
It only fills you with dread and with doubt
Left looking for an easy way out

I know you don't know
Oh no you don't know

I wanna feel happy days, happy days
Happy days, happy days
Walls of isolation inside of my pain
And I don't know if I'm ready to change
I wanna feel happy days, happy days
Happy days, happy days
All of this frustration inside of my brain
And I don't know if I'm ready to change

Some nights you call for the jaws of life
To pull you out of the crash
A forgotten ghost from your past
When enough doesn't cut it
When you're backed up against a wall
Is it the life that you wanted
When you could never have it all

I wanna feel happy days, happy days
Happy days, happy days
Walls of isolation inside of my pain
And I don't know if I'm ready to change
I wanna feel happy days, happy days
Happy days, happy days
All of this frustration inside of my brain
And I don't know if I'm ready to change

Face down in the deep end
Face down every weekend
Face down and I'm bleeding
There's no sound when you're leaving
We faced all of our demons
We chased all of our dreams and
Don't know where it leads us
We don't care at all

I wanna feel happy days, happy days
Happy days, happy days
Walls of isolation inside of my pain
And I don't know if I'm ready to change
I wanna feel happy days, happy days (face down in the deep end)
Happy days, happy days (face down every weekend)
All of this frustration inside of my brain
And I don't know if I'm ready to change

I wanna feel happy days

[Mark Hoppus (Matt Skiba):]
I don't believe that we were ever meant to be
Left underneath the light of dying stars (dying stars)
Push me off of the edge of the world (of the world)
Watch me as I slowly fall apart

Set fire to the roof of your house
And waited for the sirens to wail (sirens wail)
Left your favorite records to melt (left to melt)
Listen as you damn me to hell

[Mark Hoppus:]
Angel wings at the bus stop
Halos left on top of the bar
Heaven doesn't want me now
Heaven doesn't want me
Angel wings at the bus stop
Halos left on top of the bar
Heaven doesn't want me now
Heaven doesn't want me

[Matt Skiba:]
Well, what did I think would happen?
I wouldn't dream of asking
You waited here for me so long
I lived in fear that you moved on

What have I done to us, it seems?
I've broken trust and shattered dreams
I only wish I'd spoken up
Loneliness since we broke up

[Mark Hoppus (Matt Skiba):]
Angel wings at the bus stop
Halos left on top of the bar
Heaven doesn't want me now
Heaven doesn't want me
Angel wings at the bus stop
Halos left on top of the bar
Heaven doesn't want me now
Heaven doesn't want me
(Heaven doesn't want me)
(Heaven doesn't want me)

[Matt Skiba:]
Say a prayer that you'll make it to the other side
It won't make no sense and you lose your mind
We're lost in our ways (we're lost in our ways)
Nothing left to say, no (nothing left to say)
Make a wish that you'll get a chance to say goodbye
Before the shots ring out in the dead of night
We're stuck in our ways (we're stuck in our ways)
I've got so much to say, oh (I've got so much to say)

Showed up like shadows in this crowd
Brought the fire blinding
Came here to quickly tear us down, down, down

[Mark Hoppus (Matt Skiba):]
Angel wings at the bus stop (Whoa)
Halos left on top of the bar
Heaven doesn't want me now
Heaven doesn't want me (Whoa)
Angel wings at the bus stop
Halos left on top of the bar
Heaven doesn't want me now
Heaven doesn't want me

She's a girl dressed in black from another world
Lives and breathes like a girl from another world
She don't know my name (She don't know my name)
She don't have the time of day
Celebrate, medicate 'til we numb the pain
In this storm, it's still dark, like it always rains
She don't feel the same (She don't feel the same)
She don't have the time of day

And I wait, and I wait, and I wait
And I wait, and I wait, and I wait
And I wait for her
And I wait, and I wait, and I wait
And I wait, and I wait, and I wait
And I wait for her

I don't care what you say, no
I don't care what you do
I'm goin' to the dark side with you
I'm goin' to the dark side with you
I don't care what you say, no
I don't care what you do
I'm goin' to the dark side with you
I'm goin' to the dark side with you

She's a girl, I look back to what could have been
Her cloak and dagger, mouth tastes like medicine
She won't last the night (She won't last the night)
Spun out in the neon light
You would leave, but you need me to numb the pain
You're possessed and you slept through another day
You don't feel the same, and I don't have the strength to stay

And I wait, and I wait, and I wait
And I wait, and I wait, and I wait
And I wait for her
And I wait, and I wait, and I wait
And I wait, and I wait, and I wait
And I wait for her

I don't care what you say, no
I don't care what you do
I'm goin' to the dark side with you
I'm goin' to the dark side with you
I don't care what you say, no
I don't care what you do
I'm goin' to the dark side with you
I'm goin' to the dark side with you

(Oh) I'm goin' to the dark side with you
(Oh) I'm goin' to the dark side with you
I don't care what you say, no
I don't care what you do
I'm goin' to the dark side with you
I'm goin' to the dark side

I don't care what you say, no
I don't care what you do
I'm goin' to the dark side with you
I'm goin' to the dark side with you

I'm goin' to the dark side with you
I'm goin' to the dark side with you

(Blame it, blame it on my youth)

I wasn't born with the rich blood
I started out with plenty of nothing at all
I got stuck in the thick mud
The flash flood, punk rock and the alcohol

I was raised on a re-run
I was bored to death, so I started a band
Cut my teeth on the Safety Dance
My attention span never stood a chance

It's too late
Can you forgive me now?

You can never kill my high
I'm the ink and you're the headline, oh
Blame it, blame it on my youth
Blame it, blame it on my youth

You can never block my shine
I've been lost since 1999, oh
Blame it, blame it on my youth
Blame it, blame it on my youth

(Blame it, blame it on my youth)

I wasn't made for the good life
I ended up gettin' stuck on the side of the road
I tripped and fell on hard times
Tough breaks are the only kind I know

I was left on a door step
I was scared to death with nowhere to go
Cut myself on the neighbor's fence
That I hopped as the cops tried to take me in

It's too late
Can you forgive me now?

You can never kill my high
I'm the ink and you're the headline, oh
Blame it, blame it on my youth
Blame it, blame it on my youth

You can never block my shine
I've been lost since 1999, oh
Blame it, blame it on my youth
Blame it, blame it on my youth

I was raised on the Ritalin
Ever since I was a little kid
No one ever seemed to give a shit
And I don't need an excuse, I don't need an excuse

You can never kill my high
I'm the ink and you're the headline
Blame it, blame it on my youth
Blame it, blame it on my youth

You can never block my shine
I've been lost since 1999, oh
Blame it, blame it on my youth
Blame it, blame it on my youth

You can never kill my high (Endless summer)
I'm the ink and you're the headline, oh (Stretching on and on)
Blame it, blame it on my youth
Blame it, blame it on my youth

Endless summer stretching on and on

Is it better, is it better now?
Are we better, are we better now?
Is it better, is it better now?
Are we better, are we better now?

All we needed was a lifeline (Is it better, is it better now?)
We swore we'd be better than the last time (Are we better, are we better now?)
Donate, tell me that you're all right (Is it better, is it better now?)
I'm not the generational divide (Are we better, are we better now?)

Leave me in the sun, I'm melting like a Popsicle
Give me the flu, I'm dying in this hospital
I need you close but you got me backed against a wall
I try to speak but my mouth doesn't move at all

Sing me right back to sleep
I'll never hear your voice break down again
Need you to try to keep
Your distance and I'll come home again

Run away
Don't let me run away, no
Get away
Don't let me get away, no
When the lights come up and you see I'm gone
You wake up to an empty house
And when the music stops and you come undone
You know I'm never gonna get you out (of my head)

Met you in the dark where we stumble into mysteries
An open book that you took and now I'm history
You moved away and you left me with your dying wish
I couldn't prove it was you, you're the arsonist

Sing me right back to sleep
I'll never hear your voice break down again
Need you to try to keep
Your distance and I'll come home again

Run away
Don't let me run away, no
Get away
Don't let me get away, no
When the lights come up, when you see I'm gone
Wake up to an empty house
And when the music stops and you come undone
You know I'm never gonna get you out (of my head)

Run away
Don't let me run away, no
Get away
Don't let me get away, no

Run away
Don't let me run away, no
Get away
Don't let me get away, no
When the lights come up, when you see I'm gone
Wake up to an empty house
And when the music stops and you come undone
You know I'm never gonna get you out (of my head)

Run away
Don't let me run away, no
Get away
Don't let me get away, no

Tragedy (Tragedy)
Erased my memory (Erased my memory)
And now all I see
Is this black rain

Oh tragedy
You took my everything (You took my everything)
Oh now all I feel
All I feel is pain

Oh, how can I go on?
Knowing that I lost you
Where did I go wrong?
Where did you run off to?
Lost down here, broken and alone

I went in search of some answers
But all I found were monsters
They're under my bed
They're haunting this tie
That's been severed
This tie that's been severed
Now I follow your footsteps
Through the ashes you once crept
I feel so hollow now
I'm trapped on this island
This island of regret

Tragedy (Tragedy)
Erased my memory (Erased my memory)
And now all I see
Is this black rain

Oh tragedy
You took my everything (You took my everything)
Oh now all I feel
All I feel is pain

Oh, how can I go on?
Knowing that I lost you
Where did I go wrong?
Where did you run off to?
Lost down here, broken and alone

They left a note on the front door
With a time and a place as the tears poured from my eyes
Straight to the floor there was no going back once we knew what they came for
And all I have here is heartache
And bones, and mirrors for me to break
Only so much bad luck a person can take
We quiver and quake, we shiver and shake

Tragedy (Tragedy)
Erased my memory (Erased my memory)
And now all I see
Is this black rain
Oh tragedy

I don't really like myself without you
Every song I sing is still about you
Save me from myself the way you used to
'Cause I don't really like myself without you
I really wish I hated you

A little drunk, waiting on your phone call
A little numb, maybe I can't feel at all
You stitch me up, but you can't stop me bleeding out
I'm better when I'm broken

I love you, but I hate you when you're with someone else
And I want you wrapped around me, but I don't trust myself
I drove by your house, but you don't live there anymore

'Cause I don't really like myself without you
Every song I sing is still about you
Save me from myself the way you used to
'Cause I don't really like myself without you
I really wish I hated you right now

Won't you say something? Won't you say something?
I really wish I hated you
Won't you say something? Won't you say something?
I really wish I hated you

The sun is out, I'm dying in the daytime
I think about the future that we left behind
I drink it all, but I can't shake you from my mind
Now every window's broken

I love you, but I hate you when you're with someone else
And I want you wrapped around me, but I don't trust myself
I drove by your house, but you don't live there anymore

'Cause I don't really like myself without you
Every song I sing is still about you
Save me from myself the way you used to
'Cause I don't really like myself without you
I really wish I hated you right now

Won't you say something? Won't you say something?
I really wish I hated you
Won't you say something? Won't you say something?
I really wish I hated you

I can see that you've had enough
I can see that you're giving up on me
I can see that your hands are up
I can see that you're giving up on me

I hate the way that you're better off, better off
I numb the pain, but it never stops, never stops
Wish I could say that I'm better off, better off
Now

But I don't really like myself without you
Every song I sing is still about you
Save me from myself the way you used to
'Cause I don't really like myself without you
I really wish I hated you right now

Won't you say something? Won't you say something?
I really wish I hated you
Won't you say something? Won't you say something?
I really wish I hated you

Won't you say something? Won't you say something?
I really wish I hated you
Won't you say something? Won't you say something?
I really wish I hated you

Back down, off the ledge you're leaving me
Right now, it feels like you're bleeding me dry
Slow down, you took away a piece of me
I don't wanna let go, don't wanna let go

Chokehold, I'm running out of oxygen
Tightrope, tonight it's like I'm walking on air
Black smoke, coming from the underground
I don't wanna let go, don't wanna let

Hey! Wait! Pin the grenade!
If you don't love me, lie to my face
Hey! Wait! Get out of my brain
If you don't love me, lie to my face
Just another night before I'm lost and all alone
If you're gonna kill me, baby, please just do it slow
So hey! Wait! Pin the grenade!
If you don't love me, lie to my face

My god, how could you talk to me like that?
Let's stop, you changed your mind and caught a ride home
You dropped a hint that I embarrass you
I don't wanna let go, don't wanna let go

Midnight, I'm underneath the landslide
Fast life, I'll leave you on the side of the road
You cried, "this isn't what you promised me"
I don't wanna let go, don't wanna let

Hey! Wait! Pin the grenade!
If you don't love me, lie to my face
Hey! Wait! Get out of my brain
If you don't love me, lie to my face
Just another night before I'm lost and all alone
If you're gonna kill me, baby, please just do it slow
So hey! Wait! Pin the grenade!
If you don't love me, lie to my face

(Lie to my face)
Just another night before I'm lost and all alone
If you're gonna kill me, baby, please just do it slow
Just another night before I'm lost and all alone
If you're gonna kill me, baby, please just do it slow

Hey! Wait! Pin the grenade!
If you don't love me, lie to my face
Hey! Wait! Get out of my brain
If you don't love me, lie to my face
Just another night before I'm lost and all alone
If you're gonna kill me, baby, please just do it slow
So hey! Wait! Pin the grenade!
If you don't love me, lie to my face
If you don't love me, lie to my face
If you don't love me, lie to my face
(Hey! Wait! Pin the grenade!
If you don't love me, lie to my face)

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Photographs of you are still haunting my halls
Still framed in blue, saying nothing at all
Sacrifice myself, leave me dead in the sun
Put it on a shelf, leave it there for everyone to see
Is that all you have, is that all you have to say?

Lying on the bedroom floor
Hanging on the words that you said before
No heart, no heart to speak of
Dying on the bathroom floor
Thinking of the life that we had before
No heart, no heart to speak of

Nothing left but scars clawed away at my heart
On a crumbling edge, watch me falling apart
Feel the birds of prey circle over our home
Vultures in the ash, separating skin from bone
Is that all you have, is that all you have to say?

Lying on the bedroom floor
Hanging on the words that you said before
No heart, no heart to speak of
Dying on the bathroom floor
Thinking of the life that we had before
No heart, no heart to speak of

And I think one day
And I think one day
We'll both just fade away
And I think one day
We'll pay for our mistakes
And I think one day
I'm gonna slip away

Lying on the bedroom floor
Hanging on the words that you said before
No heart, no heart to speak of
Dying on the bathroom floor
Thinking of the life that we had before
No heart, no heart to speak of

Say the word and I'll be there
Say the word and I'll be there

She was just a babe in the woods
He was always up to no good
Of course, they'd end up as one
(Say the word and I'll be there)

She took a late-night bus to L.A
He left home with nowhere to stay
Moving to the land of the sun
(Say the word and I'll be there)

They found a spot on Bunker Hill
Though getting by was hard
The phoenix slowly turned to ashes
Hope to broken hearts

Now she's holding him for ransom
Now she's holding him for ransom
Say the word and I'll be there
Say the word and I'll be there

Now she's holding him for ransom
Now she's holding him for ransom
Now she's holding him for ransom

I suppose we got lost in Brooklyn
There's a poster on my wall
With a picture that says you're missing
My friends say I should rip it apart
Thought I saw you at the bodega
Thought I heard your voice at the bar
Time is slipping out through my fingers
I'm wishing on a burned-out star

They say forgive and forget
As long as I live, I'll let
These feelings pound in my chest
Maybe I am better off dead

The last time I saw her
She was standing on the edge
Of a good time, been a long time
Tell me how could I forget?
She had questions in her eyes
Oh, I should have realized that it was over
Yeah, it was over
The last time that I saw her

Thinking back to times in Manhattan
And that SoHo gallery
Saw the sights and your favorite paintings
You were as priceless as can be
Now I'm looking back at the city
The one that they say never sleeps
How'd things get so dark and shitty?
Sunrise always gives us the creeps

They say forgive and forget
As long as I live, I'll let
These feelings pound in my chest
Maybe I am better off dead

The last time I saw her
She was standing on the edge
Of a good time, been a long time
Tell me how could I forget?
She had questions in her eyes
Oh, I should have realized that it was over
Yeah, it was over
The last time that I saw her

Now you're just a stranger
And I feel like I let you down
Your friends say I'm a failure
And I could never prove them wrong
So call me when you're lonely
And maybe we can work it out
Fall back in our routines
Like nights I still dream about

The last time that I saw her
The last time that I saw her

The last time I saw her
She was standing on the edge
But it was over
Yeah, it was over
The last time I saw her

A bottle for breakfast trying to let go
Remember your voice but it's only an echo
I still got your makeup here on my pillow
And I'm seeing ghosts outside of my window

It was just one time
One time
Started turning into two times
A few times
Ain't been sober in a long time
A long time
Yeah you used to be all mine
All mine

It feels like last night you came over
Now I wake up and you're nowhere
I got my head hung over you
I guess I'm still hungover you

I was so wasted I couldn't see you
Didn't seem like a choice, no I'd never leave you
Nights that we stayed up days that we'd sleep through
I can still see your face outside of my window

It was just one time
One time
Started turning into two times
A few times
Ain't been sober in a long time
A long time
Yeah you used to be all mine
All mine

It feels like last night you came over
Now I wake up and you're nowhere
I got my head hung over you
I guess I'm still hungover you
(I got my head hung over you)
(I guess I'm still hungover you)

A bottle for breakfast trying to let go
Remember your voice but it's only an echo
It feels like last night you came over
Now I wake up and you're nowhere

I got my head hung over you
I guess I'm still hungover you
It feels like last night (Last night)
You came over (You came over)
Now I wake up (Now I wake up)
And you're nowhere (And you're nowhere)
I got my head hung over you
I guess I'm still hungover you
(I got my head hung over you)
(I guess I'm still hungover you)

Throw my wishes in a fountain
Deep down under where I found them
Don't let go, I'll probably drown in them
Three, two, one, but who's counting them?

Hey mom, I'm on my own
Scared to death and far from home
Can you imagine that, -magine that, -magine that
You know I'm bad at that, bad at that, bad at that

You left pieces of me along the side of the road
Right after you said you'd never leave me alone
Found myself on the wrong side of the door
I'll come in if you let me
I got a song in my head you played me over the phone
Left a light on upstairs but there ain't nobody home
All the nights that you end up all alone
Remember to forget me

This is hard, I'm one step off
I call but you're gone, I'm here but you're not
We both made a left, it don't make it right
I'm trying to forget but remember the times

Hey mom, I'm on my own
Scared to death and far from home
Can you imagine that, -magine that, -magine that
You know I'm bad at that, bad at that, bad at that

You left pieces of me along the side of the road
Right after you said you'd never leave me alone
Found myself on the wrong side of the door
I'll come in if you let me
I got a song in my head you played me over the phone
Left a light on upstairs but there ain't nobody home
All the nights that you end up all alone
Remember to forget me

Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Got a song in my head you played me over the phone
Left a light on upstairs but there ain't nobody home
All the nights that you end up all alone
Remember to forget me

Leave a light in your bedroom
For when I stumble down the hall
Got nowhere left to go to
Guess I shouldn't go anywhere at all

And I hear what you're saying
But I still keep banging away
Left a note on my windshield
Saying that you shouldn't have to

Waste another
Day of my life

Get me out of my head
Empty, left for dead
Don't make this so complicated
There's no point in a conversation

Get you out of my head
Let's both just forget
How this got so complicated
There's no point in a conversation

I can tell this time that you're leaving
Free yourself of me and my demons
Caught ever hurting your feelings
Said I can't take this no more

Ran away on a bike that I gave you
Sold it off the next day you came to
Can't stand me, can't say I blame you
I can't take this anymore
I can't stand me anymore

Get me out of my head
Empty, left for dead
Don't make this so complicated
There's no point in a conversation

Get you out of my head
Let's both just forget
How this got so complicated
There's no point in a conversation

There's no point in a conversation
There's no point in a conversation

Get me out of my head
Empty, left for dead
Don't make this so complicated
There's no point in a conversation

Get you out of my head
Let's both just forget
How this got so complicated
There's no point in a conversation

13 miles down the road lives a young boy
he's got jet black hair and blue-green eyes
and he's mine
and every now and then, he and I
would sit together on the porch
and I take off his pants
and I fuck him from behind

And I love him for his heart and soul
and I love his wrinkled scrotum too
so if you see us passing by
on some dreary rainy day
take a look at the young boy
and his naked asshole

I always flirt with death
I could kill, but I don't care about it
I can face your threats
Stand up tall and scream and shout about it

I think I'm on another world with you (with you)
I'm on another planet with you (with you)

You always get under my skin
I don't find it irritating
You always play to win
I don't need rehabilitating

I think I'm on another world with you (with you)
I'm on another planet with you (with you)

Another girl, another planet
Another girl, another planet

Space travel's in my blood
And there ain't nothing I can do about it
Long journeys wear me out but
Oh god you know we won't live without it

I think I'm on another world with you (with you)
I'm on another planet with you (with you)

I think I'm on another world with you (with you)
I'm on another planet with you (with you)

Another girl is loving you now
Another planet, forever holding you down
Another planet

From your Mom

From the walls of Tokyo
down in London town's a go-go
with the record selection
and the mirror's reflection
I'll be dancing with myself

when there's no one else in sight
in a crowded, lonely night
I wait so long for my love vibration
and I'm dancing with myself

Oh, oh, I'm dancing with myself
Oh, oh, dancing with myself
when there's nothing to lose
and there's nothing to prove
I'll be dancing with myself
Oh, oh, oh, oh

If I looked all over the world
and there's every type of girl
but their empty eyes seem to pass me by
And leave me dancing with myself

So let's sink another drink
cause it'll give me time to think
if I had the chance, I'd ask the world dance
I'd be dancing with myself

Oh, oh, I'm dancing with myself
Oh, oh, dancing with myself
if I had the chance, I'd ask the world dance
I'd be dancing with myself
Oh, oh, oh, oh

I was cruising in my Stingray late one night
when an XKE pulled up on the right
and rolled down the window of his shiny new Jag
and challenged me then and there to a drag
I said, "you're on, buddy, my mill's runnin' fine
let's come off the line, now, at Sunset and Vine
I'll go you one better if you've got the nerve
let's race all the way to dead man's curve.
Dead man's curve
Dead man's curve
Won't come back from dead man's curve

The street was deserted late Friday night
we were buggin' each other while we sat out the light
we both popped the clutch when the light turned green
you shoulda heard the whine from my screamin' machine
I flew past LaBrea, Schwab's, and Crescent Heights
and all the Jag could see were my six taillights
he passed me at Doheny then I started to swerve
but I pulled her out and there we were
at Dead man's curve

Well, the last thing I remember, Doc, I started to swerve.
And then I saw the Jag slide into the curve.
I know I'll never forget that horrible sight,
I guess I found out for myself that everyone was right
won't come back from dead man's curve
Dead man's curve, Dead man's curve
Dead man's curve, Dead man's curve
Dead man's curve, Dead man's curve

Shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker, tits, fart, turd, and twat
Shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker, tits, fart, turd, and twat
Shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker, tits, fart, turd, and twat
Shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker, tits, fart, turd, and twat
I fucked your mom
And I wanna suck my dad
And my mommy too
Oh, is this thing on?

I'm a genie in a bottle baby, come, come, come on and let me out
I'm a genie in a bottle baby, come, come, come on and let me out

Good Times [x3]
Oh baby, Good times...

Good Times

Everytime you need a...
Everytime you...
Everytime you rock the mic...

Keeping your head above water
Making Awake when you can

Good Times

He's a better rip off...
Scratching off a Friday?

Good Times

Aint we lucky we got our good times?

Why can't you see you torture me?
You're already thinking 'bout someone else
When he comes home you'll be in his arms
And i'll be gone
But i know, my day will come
I know someday, i'll be the only one

You wait for his spark
You know it'll turn you on
He's gonna make you feel
The way you wanna feel
When he starts to lie,
Makes you cry,
You know i'll be there
My day will come
I know someday i'll be the only one

Call me selfish
Call me what you like
I think its right
To want someone for all your own
And not share her love
And i'll have my way
And you won't have a say
Anyway
You don't stand a chance!

You wait for his cock
You know it'll turn you on
He's gonna make you feel
The way you wanna feel
When he starts to lie,
Makes you cry,
You know i'll be there
My day will come
I know someday i'll be the only one

My day will come
I know someday i'll be the only one

You want perfection
See your self-destruction
You don't know what you want
It's gonna take you years to find out!
Not giving up
And when you've had enough
You'll take your bruised little head and
You'll come running right back to me!

I will be the only one,
I will be the only one...

I know a guy...
He has sex with his sister
He used his dick to pop her
Four foot blister

And i know...
It's not that cool
He fucked her in my swimming pool

He's got three testicles
And he loves to...uhh...
Do shit...

FUCK YEAH!

(Deck the halls with boughs of holly fa la la la la la la la la)
(Tis the season to be jolly fa la la la la la la la la)

Outside the carolers start to sing
I can't describe the joy they bring
Cause joy is something they don't bring me

My girlfriend is by my side
From the roof are hanging sickles of ice
Their whiny voices get irritating
It's Christmas time again

So I stand with a dead smile on my face
Wondering how much of my time they'll waste
Oh god I hate these Satan's helpers

And then I guess I must've snapped
Because I grabbed a baseball bat
And made them all run for shelter

It's Christmas time again
It's time to be nice to the people you can't stand all year
I'm growing tired of all this Christmas cheer
You people scare me
Please stay away from my home
If you don't wanna get beat down
Just leave the presents and then leave me alone

Well I guess it's not cool to freak on Christmas Eve
Cause the cops came and arrested me
They had an unfair advantage

And even though the jail didn't have a tree
Christmas came a night early
Cause a guy named Bubba unwrapped my package (hot damn)

It's Christmas time again
It's time to be nice to the people you can't stand all year
I'm growing tired of all this Christmas cheer
You people scare me
Please stay away from my home
If you don't wanna get beat down
Just leave the presents and then leave me alone

I won't be home
I won't be home for Christmas
I won't be home
I won't be home for Christmas (please post my bail)
I won't be home
I won't be home for Christmas (please post my bail)
I won't be home
I won't be home for Christmas (please post my bail)
I won't be home
I won't be home for Christmas (please post my bail)
I won't be home
I won't be home for Christmas

So sorry it's over, so sorry it's over
There's so much more that I wanted and
(So sorry it's over)
There's so much more that I needed and
(So sorry it's over)
Time keeps moving on and on and on
Soon we'll all be gone

Let's take some time to talk this over
You're out of line and rarely sober
We can't depend on your excuses
'Cause in the end it's fucking useless
You can only lean on me for so long
Bring the ship about to watch a friend drown
Sit out on the ledge, begged you to come down
You can only lean on me for so long

I remember shots without a chaser
Absentminded thoughts, now you're a stranger
Cover up the scars put on your gameface
Left you in the bar to try and save face

You can only lean on me for so long
Bring the ship about to watch a friend drown
Sit out on the ledge, begged you to come down
You can only lean on me for so long
So sorry it's over, so sorry it's over
There's so much more that I wanted and
(So sorry it's over)
There's so much more that I needed and
(So sorry it's over)
Time keeps moving on and on and on
Soon we'll all be gone

Man on a mission, can't say I miss him around
Insider information, hand in your resignation
Loss of a good friend best of intentions I found
Tight lipped procrastination
Yeah later, see you around

I hate to be a downer
But I spent too many hours
Crossing days off the calendar
It don't mean nothing to me

I'm burned out like lights on a tree
Old songs, can't listen to these
Fake a smile, but all I can see
Is empty boxes and trees

Another year not in a coffin
Growing up or whatever you call it
Sometimes you get what you got
But it's not what you wanted at all
This is not another Christmas song
(Fa la la la, fa la la la)
This is not another Christmas

Why can't we get divorced for Christmas?
'Cause it just isn't the same
(It just isn't the same)
I miss the nights that we got twisted
I miss fucking in the rain
(I miss fucking in the rain)

And now (now) you're always angry
And I'm always saying I'm sorry
Depression's such a lonely business
Why can't we get divorced for Christmas?

Another year not in a coffin
Growing up or whatever you call it
Sometimes you get what you got
But it's not what you wanted at all
This is not another Christmas song
(Fa la la la, Fa la la la)
This is not another Christmas song
(Fa la la la, Fa la la la)
This is not another Christmas song

Another year not in a coffin
Growing up or whatever you call it
Sometimes you get what you got
But it's not what you wanted at all
This is not another Christmas song

Another year not in a coffin
Growing up or whatever you call it
Sometimes you get what you got
But it's not what you wanted at all
This is not another Christmas

Another year not in a coffin
Growing up or whatever you call it
Sometimes you get what you got
But it's not what you wanted at all
This is not another Christmas song

People, people, people
Where's the love in this world?
People, people, people
Where's the love in this world?

Because you're all my brothers and sisters
And we all love with one heart...

So why won't some girl suck my cock?

[Mark:] Can we turn off all the lights and have everyone bring up there lighters like its a big rock show, please?
[Mark:] Everyone bring out your lighters cause I know you all smoke pot
[Mark:] Now I want you all to sing along with me...

Silent night
Holy night
All is calm
All is bright
'Round yon virgin
Mother and child
Holy infant
So tender and mild

[Mark:] Yay! It's Christmas!
[Tom:] Yeah! And where the hell are my presents?!?
[Mark:] Hey! If you're looking for last minute christmas ideas...I think a good gift to give a guy is an orgasm!
[Tom:] I want one of those in my stocking!

Uh oh
Uh oh
Oh shit
Motherfucker!
I'm gonna start dancing!

Take off your pants dad
Your penis is the biggest thing
My Butt's ever had
Because I would know
It feels good

Shut your fucking face
Uncle fucker!

Oh how your mom is so inbred
last night I caught your mother
with your brother in her bed
five arms ten legs and four toes
the bitch has got four toes

When you fuck your family I guess
that's just the way it goes
when you fuck your family I guess that's,
that's just the way it goes
when you fuck your family I guess that's,
that's just the way it goes

But don't worry
your mom is not the only one
she's not the only one
because just the other night
I caught your dad taking your
brother's temperature with his thumb

When you go to your house
don't kneel or squat
don't kneel or squat
before you know it your dad will tie
my dick in a knot....... with his tongue

When you fuck your family I guess that's,
that's just the way it goes
when you fuck your family I guess that's,
that's just the way it goes

This one goes out
To all our fans

To all the punk rock kids
Who've been into our band

You only know us
From this one song

Here's news for you
We've been around
Six years long
And it hurts...

Fuck yeah!

My mom, she's not a woman anymore,
She dresses like a man
dresses like a man,
She's not as feminine as she
Used to be before.
Now she is so damned masculine.

I close my eyes
My mom's not a woman anymore
She's wearing a disguise
Everytime she leaves through that door.

My mom's not the same
As she was in the past
If I misbehave she kicks my ass
My mom's not quite the
Woman that she was before
When my friends come over
She likes to wrestle them down to the floor.

And I close my eyes
My mom's not a woman anymore
She's wearing a disguise
Everytime she leaves through that door.

My mom's a transvestite.

A millionaire, I'm a Young Money millionaire
Tougher than Nigerian hair
My criteria compared to your career just isn't fair
I'm a venereal disease, like a menstrual bleed
Through the pencil, and leak on the sheet of the tablet in my mind
'Cause I don't write shit, 'cause I ain't got time
'Cause my seconds, minutes, hours go to the almighty dollar
And the almighty power of that ch-cha-cha-chopper
Sister, brother, son, daughter, father; mother-fuck a copper

[Mark Hoppus:]
And that's about the time she walked away from me
Nobody likes you when you're 23
And are still more amused by TV shows
What the hell is ADD?
My friends say I should act my age
What's my age again?
What's my age again?

[Lil Wayne:]
A million here, a million there
Sicilian bitch with long hair, with coke in her derriere
Like smoking the thinnest air
I open the Lamborghini, I'm hopin' them crackers see me
Like, "Look at that bastard Weezy!"

[Mark Hoppus:]
That's about the time that bitch hung up on me
Nobody likes you when you're 23
And are still more amused by prank phone calls
What the hell is call ID?
My friends say I should act my age
What's my age again?
What's my age again?

[Lil Wayne:]
Motherfucker, I'm ill
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Motherfucker, I'm ill
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
A milli, a milli, a milli, a milli, a milli
A milli, a milli, a milli, a milli, a milli
A milli, a milli, a milli, a milli, a milli

[Mark Hoppus:]
And that's about the time she walked away from me
Nobody likes you when you're 23
And you still act like you're in freshman year
What the hell is wrong with me?
My friends say I should act my age
What's my age again?
(What's my age again?) That's about the time that she broke up with me
(Please stay with me) No one should take themselves so seriously
(Please stay with me) With many years ahead to fall in line
Why would you wish that on me?
I never wanna act my age
What's my age again?
What's my age again?

[Lil Wayne & Mark Hoppus:]
I'm ill
Motherfucker I'm ill
Motherfucker I'm ill
Motherfucker I'm ill
What's my age again?

With all those words you bring
Why do you say what you don't mean?
To those people who don't care about one thing that you might need

And you just don't know
Your actions always shine the most
To those people who don't care if you end up alone

You need some time to sew
All those bridges that you burned
'Cause there's nothing left to bring
To someone who just won't learn

Have you made up your mind?
How have you known what you decide
To those people who just think that you are telling lies

So I give up
I made it clear as it can be
To those people who don't care about one thing that you might need

You need some time to sew
All those bridges that you burned
'Cause there's nothing left to bring
To someone who just won't learn

I'm feeling what I want to feel
I'm saying what I've said all along
Because I know the things that are important to me.
Because life is too short to belong

And those thoughts
That I've kept inside
With those words
That I could not hide
Before those times that always remind me
That all I ever did was try.

So change your tune one step to make a stand
I want to speak my mind start my own african tribe
I'm alone now run into the deepest pile of shit
Cause that's where I'm going to blend in.

Go!

Those choices that I've never made
With those decisions that once cut me a break
Cause after all what's left in the end
There's somethings that they just can't take

So take a bow
Well you're not that great
So pat your back
Go off and masturbate
Cause one thing that you know for sure
Your hand is not a lonesome date.

Oh Elise it doesn't matter what you say
I just can't stay here every yesterday
Like keep on acting out the same
The way we act out
Every way to smile
Forget
And make-believe we never needed
Any more than this
Any more than this

Oh Elise it doesn't matter what you do
I know I'll never really get inside of you
To make your eyes catch fire
The way they should
The way the blue could pull me in
If they only would
If they only would
At least I'd lose this sense of sensing something else
That hides away
But you and me
There're worlds to part
With aching looks and breaking hearts
And all the prayers your hands can make
Oh I just take as much as you can throw
And then throw it all away
Oh I throw it all away
Like throwing faces at the sky
Like throwing arms round
Yesterday
I stood and stared
Wide-eyed in front of you
And the face I saw looked back
The way I wanted to
But I just can't hold my tears away
The way you do

Elise believe I never wanted this
I thought this time I'd keep all of my promises
I thought you were the girl I always dreamed about
But I let the dream go
And the promises broke
And the make-believe ran out...

So Elise
It doesn't matter what you say
I just can't stay here every yesterday
Like keep on acting out the same
The way we act out
Every way to smile
Forget
And make-believe we never needed
Any more than this
Any more than this

And every time I try to pick it up
Like falling sand
As fast as I pick it up
It runs away through my clutching hands
But there's nothing else I can really do
There's nothing else I can really do
There's nothing else
I can really do
At all...
